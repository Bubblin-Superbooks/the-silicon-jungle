<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Usefulness To Old Pros And Beginners Alike</h4><p class="  start-chapter">WordStar adjusts to different levels of skill. You have some menus to guide you, to help you decide, say, whether you want 305to print or see material you’ve already written. But most of the time you won’t need menus during composition. Not after you’re experienced, anyway. Some rival word-processing programs have menus that bog everyone down, beginners and old pros. But not WordStar. It has four “Help” levels, including one that keeps messages constantly on the screen to guide you. But you can zap all this once you’re a WordStar pro.</p></div> </div>
