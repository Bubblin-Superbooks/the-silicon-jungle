They say, ‘Boy, lawyers cost a lot,’ and I know the feeling.” Then Green brings up an exception to that opinion, lawyers. “I know a lot of consultants who will never work for lawyers because as far as lawyers are concerned the job is never complete. They understand what it means to be complete.” Their contracts reflect this; yours should, too. Have the consultant do the first draft of the contract, perhaps; but don’t shy away from extensive changes if need be. “Hell,” tell him, “that’s what your word processor’s for.” Back out of the deal if he isn’t reasonable now. He might not be later on.</p><p>When hammering out a consulting contract, you should fret over three variables emphasized by Joe Auer:</p><ul><li>“How long is it going to take?</li><li>“How much money does it cost?</li><li>“What’s the quality of the work?</li></ul></div> </div>
