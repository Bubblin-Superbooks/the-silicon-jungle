<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In short, this book is for people who want to survive—and make money—by <em>listening</em>.</p><p>Ranging over many topics, it may come across as a series of essays rather than a normal guide. So be it. I’m not going to cheat you of helpful facts that <em>most</em> readers won’t care about or that are far removed from the main thrusts of the chapters. You may be desperate for this very material. And items at the ends of the chapters will refer you to “Backup: More Tales and Tips from the Jungle.” “Backup” follows my main book.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
