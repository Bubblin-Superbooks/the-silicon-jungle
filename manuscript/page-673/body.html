Had Carsonville used Ethernet or another of the much-touted networks, it might have spent well over $1,000 to wire in <em>each</em> computer—perhaps several thousand with all the trimmings included.</p><p>Instead, Madden went by the philosophy of this book.

It offered 64 megabytes of storage, the equivalent of 32,000 double-spaced 235typewritten pages. But Madden worried if it could run programs fast enough with a number of people tugging at it simultaneously. “We had five terminals, and we dropped it to four,” he said, “because our mini slowed down horribly even with five.” Going the mini route, Madden would also have had to spend perhaps $30,000 on at least twenty more terminals without the brains of a full-fledged computer.</p></div> </div>
