The bubbles are tiny magnetized areas inside a small metal container. Magnetized “north,” a bubble might mean a bit specifying “one.” Magnetized “south,” it could mean zero. (You’ll recall that bits form a byte standing for a letter or number. Magnetic bubble memories aren’t that much faster than disks, but they <em>keep</em> remembering forever—unlike the CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor RAMs used in many portables. ) )</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">An RAM will develop amnesia if your power fails, and a CMOS RAM is no different.
