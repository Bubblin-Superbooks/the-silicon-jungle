That could be particularly true in a large company where many people can poke through a computer’s memory either in person or via other machines connected by phone or other wires.</li></ul><p>Never buy a computer without seeing for yourself that it <em>and</em> the software will together serve your needs. Don’t take the sales rep’s word. Instead, make him or his software specialist put the machine through its paces. Do so even if you’re not buying software at the store. Of course, the sales rep may not have access to the software, in which case you may want to visit another store for a demo. And if no one can assure you, no ifs or buts, that the computer-software combo works fine? Then you may want to hire a consultant.</p></div> </div>
