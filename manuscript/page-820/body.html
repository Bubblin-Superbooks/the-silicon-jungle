<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Don’t just consider storage capacity. Think about the ease of making electronic copies of information you squeeze into your computer. A hard disk capable of holding the equivalent of five thousand typewriter pages is nice. But you still must contend with floppies for backup if the hard disk fails. You must either make backup copies as you go along or else, every so often, hold a long, tedious copying session.</p><p>Fortunately, the price of hard disks is dropping quickly enough that in the future you might be able to afford a second hard disk 287to back up the one in the machine. Some micros can back up on a standard videocassette recorder—a good four-hour tape will hold 100 megabytes. Besides, there’ll eventually be cheap, reliable, roomy memories without any moving parts.</p><p>Even then, however, you’ll still want copies of some kind, especially if failures would zap thousands of pages of hard-won information.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
