<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">documents at a time, a zillion powerful editing commands, still another zillion powerful document structuring options—but it’s added a few more just for fun. For example:</p><p>◾ The old Perfect allowed you to delete from wherever the cursor is to the end of whatever sentence you’re in; the new one lets you do that, of course, and also lets you cut to the end of whatever paragraph you’re in—or an entire paragraph, if you’re at its beginning.</p><p>◾ Now you can delete not only the next word ahead of your cursor but also the word behind it—a small thing but amazingly handy.</p><p>◾ You don’t have to delete text before you copy it. (However, the process is more complicated than it used to be.)</p><p>◾ You can flush right material on screen—useful for the what-you-see-is-what-you-get feature.</p></div> </div>
