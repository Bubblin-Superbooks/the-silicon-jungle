This strikes me as amazingly handy for editing multiple documents when you can’t remember what the name of the other document is or where the reference is you’re thinking of. For example, suppose you’re writing to Joyce Davenport and you want to add a paragraph from a letter you wrote to James T. Kirk but you can’t remember more than that it was about artichokes. You would invoke “search document”; the prompter then asks you what you’re searching for, and you say, “Artichokes.” Pretty soon you have a list of the documents 315the word “artichokes” appears in, and you can then call up the one you want for multiple-document editing.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">◾ Similar to this is something new the main menu</p></div> </div>
