Here’s why.</p><p>A bit is a “1” or a “0.” Patterns of bits form bytes. And what’s a byte? Nothing more than a letter or number. So how does this tie in with the early Kaypro’s Z80 versus the IBM’s 8088?</p><p>Well, the Z80 processes information in words of only 8 bits at a time. The 8088 in the IBM, however, gulps it down in 16-bit chunks and works with larger memories—so that the IBM can run more complicated programs, like the more elaborate electronic spreadsheets for forecasting profit and loss. There’s another benefit, too. A 16-bitter doesn’t need to call up programming information as often from the spinning floppy disks, which are slower than the purely electronic memories.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Kaypro II, however, won’t <em>immediately</em> become</p></div> </div>
