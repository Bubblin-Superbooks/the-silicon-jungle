<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">the things InfoStar can do, and watching six fields fill up all by themselves after Id inputted one number made me chortle with glee.</p><p>InfoStar uses most of the same commands that WordStar does, which is convenient if you happen to <em>like</em> control commands. I first began to get annoyed when I discovered that InfoStar does not use arrow keys. If you want to move your cursor, it’s CTRL-D, CTRL-S, CTRL-E, CTRL-X—the same commands WordStar uses and a major-league annoyance. Nor have any Function keys been assigned any values. And every single, solitary time you use InfoStar you have to go through at least four help screens—like it or not. Grrr!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I first ran into trouble when I began trying to define my own data record. Drawing the screen is easy; but what does one do when one is trying to assign attributes and runs up against prompts like, “Field derived? Processing order? Copy attributes of field? Pad field?</p></div> </div>
