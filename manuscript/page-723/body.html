Clarke’s 2001—the book and movie for which he’s most famous—had come out several years before Eric’s birth. And yet as much as anything, Eric’s reply showed where we were headed in this age of specialization. He might someday be programming the future equivalents of HAL, developing new forms of artificial intelligence, and yet he apparently had not heard of HAL’s creator.</p><p>I told Eric who Clarke was. “No, thanks,” Eric tapped.</p><p>“But he’s the most famous science-fiction writer in the world,” I said, and explained the kind of issues that he might ask about.</p><p>Eric, however, still wasn’t completely impressed. “Does he understand technical things?”</p></div> </div>
