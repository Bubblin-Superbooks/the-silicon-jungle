<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><ul><li>Absence of bugs. The software maker should have gotten all the bugs out so that the program will run reliably on your computer. You can’t write a complex program that will be absolutely bug-free. But you can make it bug-free 99 percent of the time.</li><li>General ease of use. A program should be easy enough to learn and use. Being logical helps; ideally, you can use combinations of familiar commands to coax the program into doing many things that you haven’t done before.</li><li>Good documentation. The manual should be clear and logically organized. Either the simplest material should come earliest, or else there should be a beginner’s version; also, the manual should boast a good, comprehensive index.</li><li>Usefulness to beginners and old pros alike. You can adjust the best programs to suit your own level of skill with them.</li></ul></div> </div>
