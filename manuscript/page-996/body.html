<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Capture Ability</h4><p class="  start-chapter">With capture ability you can keep a record of each end of a keyboard conversation with both people typing away. You tell your computer to open up a buffer in its RAM—the temporary memory. The buffer captures the conversation. And if it fills up, some software will automatically “write” to your floppy disk, then reopen the buffer. Some programs won’t write to the disk at the ends of your conversations unless you command them to, meaning that the absentminded will see their bits and bytes vanish.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
