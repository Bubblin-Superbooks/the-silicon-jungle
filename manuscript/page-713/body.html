<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Telephone Style</h3><p class="  start-chapter">WEB-style networks mostly use a cable somewhat like the kind between the outside of your house and your phone jack. This cable has four conductors—individual wires within it. Commonly, two “hot” conductors carry computer signals. Between them, often, are two ground wires attached to the computers. You need good, solid ground connections for the networks to work right.</p></div> </div>
