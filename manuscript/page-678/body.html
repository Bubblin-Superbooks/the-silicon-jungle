He compared:</p><ul><li>How long a Kaypro took to sort dBASE II files electronically while not hooked up to the network.</li><li>How long it took while connected to the network.</li><li>How long a second Kaypro needed to sort the dBASE files in the first machine via the network.</li></ul><p>“In each case,” said Madden, “there was an increase in time, but it was still acceptable.”</p><p>So Carsonville bought The WEB and saved a pile compared to doing it with an old or a new mini.</p></div> </div>
