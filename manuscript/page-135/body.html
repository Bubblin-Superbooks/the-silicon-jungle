Cursor keys move the cursor up, down, left, or right.</li><li>A file is an electronic version of a letter, report, or other document or collection of data.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">A control key is what you start holding down to turn a letter or series of letters into commands for your computer. Used with the control key, the letters normally won’t show up in the document you’re typing. Some programs, by the way, may use the control key and an escape key, which could be a way to get from one part of the program to another.</li></ul></div> </div>
