<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Who-How is nothing more than the five Ws and the H of newspaperdom. Like a reporter, you simply ask, “Who?” “What?” “Why?” “When?” “Where?” and “How?” and especially “How much?” Ask those questions often. Ask them when:</p><ul><li>Deciding whether to hire a computer consultant. How much in your time and your people’s will it cost not to have one?</li><li>Hiring and using a consultant. It isn’t just a matter of asking, “Who?” Ask, too, “Who cares?” Who cares about a consultant’s 101two decades with IBM? What counts is how much he can do for you. Is the IBM experience relevant?</li><li>Training employees. Don’t clutter your people’s minds with computerese not related to their jobs. Use the five Ws and the H to strip the training to the basics—which, by the way, almost surely won’t include BASIC.</li></ul></div> </div>
