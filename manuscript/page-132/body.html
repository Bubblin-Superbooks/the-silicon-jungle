It’s the programs that run on them which will make the difference.</p><p>WordStar is at least adequate, and mostly superb, in all but the last of these areas:</p><ul><li>Absence of bugs. The software maker should have gotten all the bugs out so that the program will run reliably on your computer. You can’t write a complex program that will be absolutely bug-free. But you can make it bug-free 99 percent of the time.</li><li>General ease of use. A program should be easy enough to learn and use. Being logical helps; ideally, you can use combinations of familiar commands to coax the program into doing many things that you haven’t done before.</li><li class=" stretch-last-line">Good documentation. The manual should be clear</li></ul></div> </div>
