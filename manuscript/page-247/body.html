With the VisiCalc spreadsheet it could juggle around dozens of interrelated statistics, using nightmarishly elaborate algebra with Catch-22-like mathematical spirals. In other words, 88you wanted to know the value of <em>x</em>, and it depended on the value of <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>, and you couldn’t solve for <em>y</em> until you solved <em>z</em>, and you couldn’t solve for <em>z</em> until you knew <em>x</em>. That’s how it worked, except, quite possibly, Scharf and his staff would be wrestling with, say, <em>a</em> through <em>k</em> instead of just <em>x</em> through <em>z</em>.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Struggling with these Catch-22s, the Apple was a slowpoke by computer standards. It still took half an hour. That might seem like the Indy 500 to someone accustomed to hand calculations. But Scharf must have felt the same way I did about inferior word-processing software. However faster than without a computer, it still limited your possibilities. You didn’t have as much</p></div> </div>
