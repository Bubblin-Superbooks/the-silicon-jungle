An experienced librarian at a public library operated a terminal for me there. And yet at the time even she could find next to nothing on crimes <em>against</em> microcomputers. In-Search might have 225saved much—and maybe even most—of the $35.</p><p>Under the circumstances, in fact, I would better have spent the $35 on long-distance calls to the right authorities, which is what I did. Information services aren’t panaceas. Most of this book comes from old-fashioned print and interviews.</p><p>My work habits will change, however, as more people tap into data bases and the costs decline; I’ll be very selfish and put in a good word for Dialog and the rest, hoping eventually to share these economies of scale!</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
