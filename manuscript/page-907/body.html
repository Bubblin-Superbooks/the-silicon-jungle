For example:</p><p>◾ The old Perfect allowed you to delete from wherever the cursor is to the end of whatever sentence you’re in; the new one lets you do that, of course, and also lets you cut to the end of whatever paragraph you’re in—or an entire paragraph, if you’re at its beginning.</p><p>◾ Now you can delete not only the next word ahead of your cursor but also the word behind it—a small thing but amazingly handy.</p><p>◾ You don’t have to delete text before you copy it. (However, the process is more complicated than it used to be.)</p><p>◾ You can flush right material on screen—useful for the what-you-see-is-what-you-get feature.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">◾ You can more or less paginate on screen—although this instruction is only good for the what-you-see-etc. editing; it’s useless for the document-design</p></div> </div>
