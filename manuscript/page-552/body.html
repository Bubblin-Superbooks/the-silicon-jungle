<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">erase an electronic file—say, a letter or report on your disk—just by following the directions in your software? A snoop might recover the information with a special program like Disk Doctor. Luckily, however, you can zap a sensitive file by magnetically “writing” over its part of the disk. Say you want to wipe out a letter 500 words long, File A. Well, do the following:</p><ul><li>See if your disk has a file at least 500 or 600 words long. If so, make a copy. If not, type out a file that long. I’ll call this new file “B.”</li><li>“Write” File B’s contents under A’s name. “Overwrite” in other words.</li><li>Erase A.</li></ul><p>To <em>really</em> erase an entire disk? Well, don’t depend on your computer’s “copy” program or “format” program. Instead, just sweep a magnet over it—within a quarter inch or so.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">So much for the James Bond kind of data security.</p></div> </div>
