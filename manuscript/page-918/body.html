<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">WordStar. Suppose it’s a ten-word sentence you want to underline: you’d go to the start of the sentence and keystroke something like this: Control-P-S, Control-F, Control-F, Control-F, Control-F, Control-F, Control-F, Backspace, Backspace, Control-P-S.</p><p>I’ll break discipline and object to Mary’s description of the WordStar underlining procedure. You could underline a sentence just by starting with one Control-P-S and ending it with another. What’s the big deal, Mary? Your described procedure would apply only to material that you underlined <em>after</em> you wrote it. All those Control-Fs do is make the cursor jump a word ahead. <em>Grrr!</em> Then again, maybe I’m simply a more decisive underliner. I <em>know</em> what I want! If nothing else, this little disagreement shows how work habits influence choices in word processors.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Not only does the new Perfect Writer have the old Perfect’s strengths—split-screen editing of up to seven</p></div> </div>
