Like two people on the phone. A half-duplex modem would allow just one-way communications without switching; it’s somewhat comparable to a radio with an unwieldy send-receive control. There are times, however, when half duplex would be best. Normal phone lines, voice grade ones in telephone company language, can’t handle computers jabbering at too high a speed, and half duplex may work better than full.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Like most modems for personal computers in the early 1980s, Fuller’s gizmo transmitted information at 300 baud—equivalent to 300 bits a second, 30 characters per second, or 360 words per minute at 5 letters a word. When telecommuting, however, you may be better off with a modem going 1,200 baud. After all,</p></div> </div>
