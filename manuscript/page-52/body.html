<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For Non-Linear Systems Kay developed the world’s first commercially successful digital voltmeter. It was the result of some memories from World War II, when unskilled workers were constantly damaging voltmeters and having trouble reading them accurately. Kay’s new machine easily survived the careless. The instrument displayed numbers and didn’t require workers to make a reading off the thin needle of a conventional meter adjusted for the right voltage. “I don’t look at myself particularly as an inventor,” Kay said. “I’m a solver of problems. There are inventors who have many, many more ideas than I get.” Instead, he tried to refine ideas in “ways that make sense from an industrial-engineering standpoint and a customer standpoint.”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Kay’s digital voltmeter was perfect for the military and for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA and their contractors; unskilled people could help test thousands of voltages on</p></div> </div>
