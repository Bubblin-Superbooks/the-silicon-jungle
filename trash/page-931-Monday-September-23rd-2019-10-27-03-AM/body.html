Here are some terms and ideas to keep in mind:</p><p>◻ The data base, or data file, contains all your entries. InfoStar allows any number of data files per diskette; others allow only one.

How many data records will your program allow before it seizes up and refuses to accept any more? Will the program warn you that as of X moment its files are full and it won’t accept any more records?
