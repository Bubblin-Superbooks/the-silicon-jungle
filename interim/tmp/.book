Also, however, an arch rival, Kaypro, had come out with a better machine. I bought one.</p>",
  "page-23": "<p>Chapters 2 and 3 tell how Kaypro has fought Osborne and other foes—wars of interest to you, since you’ll win a better deal if you know about micro-makers and the origins of their computers. While this chapter and the next one focus on Kaypros, much in them would apply to other machines.</p><p>Most microcomputers don’t emerge from tile-floored laboratories; instead, they come from companies that refine existing technology and carve out niches in the marketplace. But what’s “refine”? High tech is enough of a gamble for the more solid computer makers. Shakier ones can be reckless, and often at customers’ expense. A newspaper perceptively observed, “Computers are hyped before they’re ready, announced before they’re shipped and sometimes outdated and outpriced before they reach retailers’ shelves.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I’ll try to <em>help</em> you find the machine that’s best for you—not necessarily the one that computer hustlers</p>",

  "page-25": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">disks. In fact, you should even think “software” before you do hardware, because your machine will be useless if it doesn’t do the tasks you want it to. And the programs supply these necessary instructions. More than thirty thousand programs for micros are on the market; so The Silicon Jungle can’t say which one is exactly right for you, but it can help you find out for yourself by showing how a software classic comes into existence.</p><p>I talked to Seymour Rubinstein and Rob Barnaby—the subjects of Chapter 4, “WordStar: The Creators”—and learned that Barnaby and I had some common work habits. Maybe that’s why I like WordStar so much. I feel as if the people behind it used ESP to discover how I liked to move words around on my spooky green screen.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Some complain that WordStar is too complex. I disagree. New versions of WordStar and other</p>",
  "page-26": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">programs, however, will become simpler to learn as the machines themselves grow more powerful. The new WordStar 2000 is an example.</p><p>Smart production-minded buyers meanwhile should avoid the “user-friendly” software that’s easy to learn but hard to use. One example is the Select, a clunky word processor discussed in Chapter 5 after WordStar. I expressed my loathing with my wallet. Although Select came free with my Kaypro, I junked it. Had I not spent my $250 on WordStar, I would have taken much, much longer to write this book.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In Chapter 6, “Three Software Stories,” businessmen tell how they coexisted—or didn’t—with their software. One of them is the New York real estate executive mentioned earlier. He saved his new employer $200,000 a year by boning up on software and using micros rather than expensive time and an outside company’s mainframe. A Maryland construction</p>",
  "page-27": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">executive did well, too. He thinks his software knowledge helped him snare a new job as a company president with one-third interest in the firm.

Another man, an accountant good at his work but uneasy around computers, offers some observations on the failings of existing software and his difficulties finding the right program.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Graphics will be one of the hotter software topics over the next few years, now that cheap computers can do more visual tricks. And in Chapter 7 and Backup VII, you’ll learn (1 the basics, (2 when charts are worth the trouble, and (3 how to select the best programs in that category. Most existing computer guides are overly technical about graphics, or they just about shun the subject. That’s too bad.

But you can’t always trust credentials, and here you’ll read of a young company that wasted $40,000 on the wrong consultants and their bungles. One man was so learned in computers that he had helped design the systems on an aircraft carrier, yet he lacked the exact technical expertise to help the company get <em>its</em> work done.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">My old newspaper in the Midwest made another people-type mistake, letting a computer expert befuddle staffers with technical jargon.

You use a calculator without being—as one man put it—“calculator literate.” Why must you be “computer literate”? Be so if you’re an aspiring programmer or if you enjoy computers as a hobby. If, however, you don’t, well, forget it. Instead, simply concentrate on (1 finding the right experts for the grubby technical chores and (2 helping yourself and your employees learn <em>the programs of use on the job</em>. ) )</p><p>You can also treat people well by guarding against “The Hal Syndrome.” I’ve named Chapter 9 after the uppity computer in 2001 and 2010.</p>",
  "page-30": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The best weapons against Hal are good, common-sense ones, like viewable screens and easy-to-use keyboards, which can cut down on headaches and backaches. Forget about the white tiles 9and bright fluorescents you see in traditional computer rooms. They can torture your eyes. As for keyboards, you’ll learn the wisdom of using the detachable kind, which makes it easier for you to be the right distance from both the keyboard and the screen. Why not buy equipment that can adjust to both your eyes and your back? Foreigners caught on to this issue much more quickly than we did; some European firms even sawed the keyboards off American-made terminals. And now U.S. workers are demanding action. “They affected my stomach quite a bit,” a former insurance company worker says of the machines that caused her to quit her job. “Most days I worked I would throw up in the ladies room.” Whether you use micros or big computers,</p>",
  "page-31": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">you’ll get more work out of people—and be able to hire better ones—if the equipment is comfortable to use. Still another precaution against Hal is good job design. See if you can rotate your employees’ computer work with other duties to reduce the stress of being at the keyboard all day.</p><p>In the Hal Syndrome chapter, you won’t simply read academic wisdom. Instead, you’ll hear about the true health and safety concerns of people working the computer keyboards—eminently valid worries in many cases.</p><p>And you’ll read in an accompanying backup about another hot topic in this era of contact between man and machine. It’s the mouse, the palm-sized gadget that you push along your desktop to guide the cursor (the little blinking line or other marker that shows where you’re typing on the computer screen).</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Some manufacturers love the mouse as a marketing</p>",

See Backup , “Of Mice and Men.”</p><p>I’ll also try some candor on another touchy topic—computer crime.</p><p>In Chapter 10, “Jewels that Blip,” you’ll learn how to protect your company secrets inside your computer and how to prevent the machines from suffering amnesia and destroying electronic records. Although electronic Willie Suttons exist, your real worries are often mundane.

A Michigan company may be enjoying as much as DLR $1,000 a year more in effective work time from each staffer as a result of its internal computer net.</p><p>Of course, with today’s imperfect technology, such hookups can be a real struggle.

But he didn’t always produce the neatest copy. “How different now!” he exulted in an article. “Staring at a page of type on a television screen, I eagerly look for typos so I can have the fun of changing them.” You needn’t be a professional author, however, to benefit from computerized writing.

I have a feeling that Playboy, at least, she could discuss with me.”</p><p>It was like radio during the 1920s, this micro craze.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Time had proclaimed the computer “Machine of the Year” in 1982, and I recalled a song that a friend of my parents, an old woman, had written years ago. “Marconi, Marconi,” the lyrics went, “the world is at your feet.” How long until the novelty of microcomputers seems just as quaint as that of radio? The parallels could be there. Two San Francisco-area authors, Andrew Fluegelman and Jeremy Joan Hewes, in Writing in the Computer Age, urged readers to “become full-fledged computer citizens—as writers, poets, artists, musicians, programmers,</p>",

Modifying their original plans somewhat, his people at Non-Linear Systems had homed in on their rival’s weaknesses, giving their own computer a better screen and a better keyboard and the ability to store more data. Adam Osborne had struck back with a jazzed-up version of his first machine. By 1983, many other companies were in the fray, including Seequa Computer Corporation, a Maryland manufacturer whose computer sold for less than $2,000 and ran most IBM-style programs.</p><p>In mid-1983 an industry expert was saying Kay and Osborne 16might together enjoy $200 million a year in micro sales at the retail level. That was just a fraction of the $5-billion-a-year market for business micros, but the two firms then seemed the largest makers of portables in the $1,000-$2,000 range.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kay waged his marketing war from several hillside buildings in Solana Beach, a small town near San Diego,</p>",
  "page-47": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">hundreds of miles south of Osborne and the rest of Silicon Valley. His was a family business. Kay’s personal housekeeper served salads and fruit juice in the corporate lunch room, and his eighty-six-year-old father, known around the plant as “Grandpa,” repaired electronic equipment and ran a forklift. Andy Kay’s wife was secretary of the company. One son, David, was the vice-president for marketing and had helped develop the Kaypro; a second son worked in personnel, and a third ran the print shop; and Andy Kay’s daughter and her husband had designed the buildings—which were now the same light blue as the “KAYPRO II” lettering on the computer. Altogether, some 450 people worked for Kay’s company by mid-1983. That was more than twice the number a year earlier when the Kaypro II was just hitting the market and Kay was counting on a mere $10 million in sales.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Bulldozers were growling away amid the expansion,</p>",

Math was another love. Andy even considered a career as an actuary after Prudential Life told him he could eventually make $15,000 a year. “I flipped out,” Andy said, “because it was a lot of money in 1935.” Frank shrugged off the $15,000, however. “That’s not very much,” he said. The words, incredibly, came from a man who seldom made more than $1,000 a year during Andy’s youth and who sometimes earned just $15 a week.</p><p>Andy, growing up in Clifton, New Jersey, took it for granted he could never afford college, but then the letters M.I.T. came up in a drafting class.</p>",

Kay reached California through a job, although for years he’d been hoping to enjoy the warm climate there. He started his company in Solana Beach rather than Silicon Valley because he was already working in the area. Osborne himself would found his own firm while 18living in Berkeley—he’d locate it in Hayward, a medium-sized city within twenty miles of the Valley proper, the Palo Alto-San Jose area southeast of San Francisco.</p>",
  "page-52": "<p>For Non-Linear Systems Kay developed the world’s first commercially successful digital voltmeter. It was the result of some memories from World War II, when unskilled workers were constantly damaging voltmeters and having trouble reading them accurately. Kay’s new machine easily survived the careless. The instrument displayed numbers and didn’t require workers to make a reading off the thin needle of a conventional meter adjusted for the right voltage. “I don’t look at myself particularly as an inventor,” Kay said. “I’m a solver of problems. There are inventors who have many, many more ideas than I get.” Instead, he tried to refine ideas in “ways that make sense from an industrial-engineering standpoint and a customer standpoint.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kay’s digital voltmeter was perfect for the military and for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA and their contractors; unskilled people could help test thousands of voltages on</p>",

But that was hardly enough to sustain a corporation. What about the future? How to avoid the boom-and-bust cycle of government spending?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kay decided to carve out a niche as a maker of rugged portable test gear for private industry. He wanted to offer many of the same wrinkles found in costly, bench-bound equipment, and one of those features was a microprocessor in a voltmeter: a miniature electronic brain that would make it easier to use. The idea came from an old friend, Bill McDonald,</p>",
  "page-54": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">whom Kay had met decades earlier at M.I.T. Their gym lockers were next to each other’s there; both men had loved handball and hated team sports. McDonald, a husky man of basketball-player height, had worked for Non-Linear Systems in the early 1950s, then had returned East, where he had acquired a computer background. Then, in the late 1970s, he’d rejoined Non-Linear Systems, where his friend Kay hoped he would help develop a computer. Correctly or not, Kay believed that “ninety percent of the electronics business was computer and ten percent was test equipment, hi-fi, stereo, and stuff like that.” Non-Linear Systems had offered other companies’ minicomputers in systems it packaged for military contractors, but still wasn’t 19making machines of its own. Maybe a small business machine would be one way to enter computerdom.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Two months after Bill came to work for me,” Kay recalled, “he showed me some microprocessor-based</p>",
  "page-55": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">computers for doing accounts payable-receivable at the local computer dealer’s place.</p><p>“They were very reasonable, so I bought some and was very intrigued with them. And I wondered: ‘Why not make this stuff? I could make a better disk drive. And look at this: this connector doesn’t work too well.’ And Bill said, ‘We could make them, all right, but I don’t know where you’d sell them.’ This was in late 1979. I said okay and dropped the idea.”</p><p>Two years later, however, Kay watched his architect son-in-law, Michael Batter, struggling with an Apple and knew the time was ripe for an easier-to-tote portable.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kay tried VisiCalc, the electronic spreadsheet, on the Apple and came away thinking the machine was too complicated, beyond being a hassle to move from home to office. So Kay told Bill McDonald, “Listen, we’re selling instruments to engineers. Let’s make a computer</p>",
  "page-56": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that we can walk in to an engineer and set on his desk and say, ‘Hey, look at this. You can use it.’”</p><p>Still, Kay worried about the new technology. “It’s a fairly stylized dance,” McDonald reassured him in spring 1981. “You buy the chips, and there is black magic in getting them to work—but not in how they work.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Okay,” came the reply, “that’s it. We’ll get rid of the disadvantages of the Apple and cram our computer into one box without cables all over the place.” In ads the Apple looked incredibly compact. Actually, though, serious computer users needed disk drives to store large amounts of information for quick retrieval. They also needed a TV-like monitor to see the letters and numbers they typed out on the computer. And Kay wisely wanted everything squeezed into one box. If you bought his machine, you’d get the whole works except perhaps for the printer, which spewed out your</p>",
  "page-57": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">calculations or typed up your letter. Also, it would cost you less than a full Apple system. Kay could bring down the cost of a complete machine if he planned on every computer being one.</p><p>All this was the logical culmination of Kay’s skill in shrinking gear for the military and aerospace industry. For years he had been making printed circuit boards and filling them with components. And he could order the disk drives, keyboards, and other special computer-type parts from outside suppliers.</p><p>The way Kay tells it, he had no idea—at first—that he was about to take on Adam Osborne. “It was six months,” he said, “before we ever saw Osborne’s literature. He introduced his computer 20in March 1981, but I didn’t know anything about it.” Some would question that statement, of course, given the novelty of the Osborne 1 and its creator’s flair for publicity.</p>",
  "page-58": "<p>Whatever happened—with Osborne in mind or not—Kay selected the same basic technology and essentially similar parts.</p>",
  "page-59": "<h3>A Z80-style Microprocessor</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">A microprocessor is simply the main brains that tie together the memory devices, the keyboard, and other parts of the computer. You can also call it a central processing unit (CPU).</p><p>Okay, but why a Z80 in the Kaypro?</p><p>That’s simply a style of chip from a company called Zilog. “You could buy those all over the place,” Kay said. “We wanted something proven and reliable.” The Z80 was the only kind of CPU that could run CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers)-style programs, then an industry standard.</p>",
  "page-60": "<p>The Z80, though, can’t handle programs as complicated as the newer 8088 chip that ended up in IBM PCs and countless clones. Here’s why.</p><p>A bit is a “1” or a “0.” Patterns of bits form bytes. And what’s a byte? Nothing more than a letter or number. So how does this tie in with the early Kaypro’s Z80 versus the IBM’s 8088?</p><p>Well, the Z80 processes information in words of only 8 bits at a time. The 8088 in the IBM, however, gulps it down in 16-bit chunks and works with larger memories—so that the IBM can run more complicated programs, like the more elaborate electronic spreadsheets for forecasting profit and loss. There’s another benefit, too. A 16-bitter doesn’t need to call up programming information as often from the spinning floppy disks, which are slower than the purely electronic memories.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Kaypro II, however, won’t <em>immediately</em> become</p>",
  "page-61": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a has-bit—er, has-been. “Converting the Kaypro to a 16-bit machine is no big deal,” Kay observed. In fact, several months after he said it, his company announced a computer called the Kaypro II Plus 88 with both the 8-bit Z80 and the 16-bit 8088. It couldn’t run all IBM programs, especially those boasting graphics or pictures as well as words and numbers. Here, as in many cases, the term “IBM compatible” is grossly misleading. There are degrees of compatibility, and even if a computer supposedly uses the same style of floppy disks, you must test it with the program <em>you</em> want to run. (Many computer aficionados test for general IBM compatibility by running a game called Flight Simulator, 21or Lotus 1-2-3, a program combining a spreadsheet with graphics and several other capabilities.)</p><p>Some existing programs, by the way, are configured so that it doesn’t matter much whether you’re running the 8- or 16-bit version.</p>",

It feels like a typewriter.” And the keys,</p>",
  "page-73": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">unlike the Osborne’s, were in all the right places for people weaned on Selectrics.

The Kaypro reminded me of old Heathkits, of smoky soldering irons, of crisp, cold evenings in my youth when I’d listened through the static for the whistling dots and dashes from my fellow hams. But many people shrugged off the Kaypro’s appearance as unprofessional, and so I asked about the</p>",
  "page-74": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">case. Kay said its contents dictated the shape. “Unless we created air space and made it larger,” he said, “we couldn’t have made the shape much different.” A hood shaded the Kaypro’s cathode ray tube (CRT; the TV-like screen). And as it turned out, that matched the comfortable slope of the keyboard that attached to the front of the machine for carrying. I noticed only a few adornments added for buyers’ eyes. One was the blue “KAYPRO II” lettering on the case and the stripes on it and the keyboard; another was the blue color of the keys on the calculatorlike numbers pad. No, you couldn’t mistake the Kaypro for a Gucci creation. And yet, as good, functional design, the Kaypro succeeded: at least one other portable appeared in a sharp-edged metal box.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The location of my Kaypro’s two disk drives, to the right of the CRT, was especially logical. Kay and his engineers wanted them well separated from a high-voltage transformer on the left—an electrical</p>",
  "page-75": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">component that was part of the video circuitry and whose magnetic radiation could interfere with the operation of the drives. Bill McDonald noted the Osborne disks were on either side of the tube. Circuitry for a nine-inch tube produced more electronic noise than that given off by a five-incher. And McDonald speculated that this was one reason Osborne had to make do with the smaller size.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Inside the Kaypro, atop the printed circuit boards, you saw integrated circuits with leglike leads of the kind that one writer compared to caterpillars. You found somewhat similar looking parts inside the Osborne. But there was a difference. “Oh, my God,” said Michael Pond, owner of a Washington-area Kaypro dealership, the Computer Shoppe, “once you take the cover off the Osborne, everything sort of falls apart in your hand. It’s held together by the wiring harness. It’s like a jellyfish.” That may have been a bit off target. Chris Christiansen,</p>",
  "page-76": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">however, a computer analyst with the Yankee Group, a high-tech marketing research firm, compared the Osborne to a Chinese puzzle and said an 26Osborne user “in the next office gets very nervous when I come around with a screwdriver.” By contrast the Kaypro looked eminently repairable. “When you take one part of the machine off,” Pond said, “the rest of the machine doesn’t fall apart.” Andy Kay’s people had divided up the circuitry into several modules that repairmen could remove <em>easily</em>. His computer had far fewer chips than the old Apple II. And with fewer chips, repair people more often could locate glitches by replacing various parts until the machine was working again. Fondly, Pond said the Kaypro II was “over-engineered,” like an early-model Volvo.</p><p>“Well,” you’re wondering, “what about the Kaypro I?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It never existed except as a prototype.

  "page-77": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">II didn’t hurt Kay’s efforts to convince buyers that he had one up on Osborne.</p><p>The prototype’s screen was between the disk drives, interfering with them, and another flaw became clear: the shortness of the cable between the keyboard and the main unit. Bill McDonald was worried. Suppose a customer crushed a finger while wrestling with the little cable? Why not hinge the keyboard to the twenty-pound console? And that’s how Non-Linear Systems indeed built the prototype. But McDonald still fretted that someone might undo the latches; and so, driven by fear of a lawsuit from a klutzy Kaypro owner, the engineers redesigned the computer to accommodate a coiled cord several feet long.</p><p>Altogether, Andy Kay’s people spent only a year and less than half a million dollars developing the Kaypro II.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“After we’d been at it eight or nine months,” he said, “someone brought in some literature from Osborne,</p>",
  "page-78": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">who had just announced his portable computer.

His hillside buildings didn’t look like normal factories; they were long and narrow, well windowed, split into small rooms without the racket of mechanized production lines. Kay described his workers as “always moving, interacting constantly. If one piece is missing, they work around that. If one person is slow because he happens to be new, they work around him and help him out. It’s exactly the same approach we used for stuffing printed</p>",

It uses the least amount of capital equipment, and it’s the easiest on the assemblers, because they aren’t just sitting or standing in one spot.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lacking a conventional assembly line, Kay said he needed few mid-level managers; and even after Kay went public, he still hated to bring in MBAs. Managers built empires. They feuded. They got in producers’ way. That was how Kay felt, apparently—a legacy of the 1960s when Non-Linear Systems had splurged thousands on those seven vice-presidents and their white Cadillacs. But some practices from the go-go years lingered. One, said Kay, was participative management, the philosophy that had led to the formation of those small, friendly assembly teams. The atmosphere around the plant was informal. “We have very few written policies on anything,” he said. No dress code existed, save for an informal ban on attire like short</p>",
  "page-84": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">shorts—a policy bent to accommodate workers who labored in the hot Southern California sun.</p><p>Also, Andy Kay’s company at times hired people with unusual backgrounds. Clifford Odendhal, a musician-dancer-songwriter in 29his thirties, had come by way of COJO Wind, David Kay’s alternative energy firm. David asked Odendhal to help Non-Linear Systems catch up on back correspondence, leading to a customer-service job there. Eventually, Odendhal was helping with public relations. “This is the first job outside of entertainment that I have ever cared about beyond my paycheck,” he said.</p><p>Andy said of David, “He’s less cautious about hiring people than I am. If they don’t work out, he just lets them go.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">David, a six-foot-three-inch surfer with a degree in math and a hobby of collecting dictionaries, had himself started with the company several years before</p>",

Now he was vice-president for marketing, and when an investment banker asked Andy if David was a vice-president because he was Andy’s son or because he was the best man for the job, Andy replied: “Both.” He believed that David’s role in the development and marketing of the Kaypro “was extremely important. In thirty years I’ve never seen a man in marketing who measures up to one-tenth the dedication and performance he’s shown.”</p><p>Andy’s son used what the Wall Street Journal described as “idiosyncratic” marketing techniques. Dealers couldn’t sell Kaypros by mail. They didn’t enjoy extended credit. The Kaypro Division, in fact, did not even spend much at first on national advertising.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Examined closely, however, each policy seemed logical.

Andy Kay appreciated this. “If a fellow does mail order and the contract says he can’t,” Kay said, “David cuts him off without a qualm. Maybe the dealer says we need him or he won’t be able to support his family and kids. Well, forget it. This is a business, but it’s also our livelihood, too.” Of course, not all mail-order establishments in the computer trade were unethical: I knew of some good ones. But from a manufacturer’s viewpoint the policy made sense. The Kays at the time wanted to befriend the independent dealers, who were less likely to flood the market with heavily discounted computers than the chains were.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">However sympathetic to the independents, Kaypro didn’t follow the lead of some expansion-minded</p>",

A California chain folded, owing hundreds of thousands to Apple as well as customers. As to how he originally picked up many 30dealers, Andy Kay said, “The orders just started rolling in. Now we’re sort of clearing out dealers which are operating out of backs of cars or whatever.”</p><p>Kay was also benefiting by selling through his own network rather than being at the mercy of distributors—and supporting their profit margins.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">By the summer of 1983, Kaypros were selling at some thousand dealerships. Christiansen observed that Kaypro gave dealers “30 or 40 percent margins. So does Osborne. That’s how they get the dealers to carry the damned things. You know, when you have fifty guys a week knocking on your door, you pick the one who’s going to put the most money in your pocket, and Osborne and Kaypro both know how to play this game</p>",
  "page-88": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">as well as or better than anyone else. How do you think Kaypro went from nothing in 1982 to 100,000 units in 1983?” Kay disputed this. He said that the Kaypro’s quality sold the computers, that he hadn’t offered more than 25 percent dealer discounts, and never would; and his claim seemed creditable enough when some stores dropped the Kaypro because the markup wasn’t big enough. Whatever the facts, Kaypro in 1983 boasted sales offices in some fifteen U.S. cities and one in the Netherlands. One-third of the computer-store ads in the Washington Post business supplement of August 8, 1983, mentioned the Kaypro.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The limited <em>national</em> advertising was equally wise. Why not depend at first on local ads telling where people could buy the product? And what was the use of creating a demand for more computers than Kaypro could make?

  "page-89": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the market that the Kaypro was now enjoying.</p><p>Besides, Kay was benefiting from something better than advertising: the articles of friendly writers. And why not? Writing was just another form of word processing—a category for which most Kaypro owners had bought their machines. Certainly the Selectric-style keyboard and 80-column screen had impressed <em>me</em>. Peter McWilliams, the very same writer who had led. The Kaypro wasn’t the best computer, period. But at the time Fallows praised the Kaypro to the millions of TV Guide readers, it may well have been the best dollar-for-dollar value. Fallows himself didn’t own a Kaypro.

One, in Esquire, showed a</p>",
  "page-90": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">young Kaypro user in an office swept by a fierce wind, blowing coworkers’ papers away and tousling his hair, while he was typing happily away with his chair and desk raised a foot off the floor, “KAYPRO RISES TO THE OCCASION,” said the advertisement. I didn’t really see the point. The technical specs were buried in small print at the bottom of the page; why couldn’t the ad tell me in large print and simple language what the Kaypro could <em>do</em>? A Kaypro staffer said the ad was to build name recognition. Then the company might unleash a campaign portraying its steel ugly duckling as the Volkswagen of small computers. It seemed a sensible-enough idea. Then, again, it was another indication that the computer business was becoming more like Detroit—selling not only economy but the <em>image</em> of economy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Finally, the new ads came out. In simple, helpful language they told novices what to look for in a small</p>",
  "page-91": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">business computer. And yet you could hardly confuse the ads’ goals with Consumer Reports'. The ads for beginners recommended consulting with an expert before choosing a machine; at the same time ads in sophisticated magazines like Byte asked computer pros to suggest the Kaypro to beginners. (“Once you tell people about the complete business computer for $1,595,” said an ad appearing after the Kays lowered the price $200, “they’ll probably stop bugging you with a lot of questions.”)</p><p>The public relations campaign was just as slick. No one lied. But Hill & Knowlton, the fast-track public relations agency, laced its Kaypro releases with quotes skillfully reflecting the computer makers’ self-interest. In one, David Kay said, “If it isn’t portable, it doesn’t pay to buy it.” That was hyperbole, pure and simple.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The nine-inch screen, for instance, was a major improvement over the Osborne, and it was entirely</p>",
  "page-92": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">right for an economy portable from which many buyers would eventually trade up, anyway; but writers and other heavy-duty users might prefer a twelve-incher from the very start. For not much more than the Kaypro at the time of the release, you could buy a desktop computer called the Morrow Micro Decision with good software and a twelve-inch 32screen. Milton Viorst, a Washington journalist, couldn’t stomach the Kaypro monitor. He considered the Kaypro the kind of machine you might tote back and forth between home and the beach but not the best for heavy-duty viewing. He bought the Morrow, or two, actually: one for himself and one for his wife, Judith, a well-known poet and magazine writer. However pro-Kaypro, I could see why. The Kaypro, strictly speaking, wasn’t even portable; instead, it was <em>transportable</em>. Unless you were a 300-pound tackle playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers, you weren’t about to tote a sharp-edged, 26-pound</p>",

But the seven-page “feature information”—the part intended for publication—mentioned the computer by name just once and in an inconspicuous location. It laid out the specs for a good portable. Then, several hundred words after the Kaypro mention, it triumphantly concluded, “For as little as $1,795, you can already buy the only fully portable personal computer with a full-sized screen, one that offers large enough memory capacity to handle business,</p>",
  "page-94": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">entertainment and educational programming and a service network that’s available anytime or anyplace—just like the optimal portable personal computer itself.” I recalled the canned releases from food companies that women’s pages ran verbatim. How many newspapers and magazines would do the same with “feature information” from Kaypro? David and his father had made a good machine. And yet I wondered how many manufacturers of bad computers might start using similar tactics. Joel Strasser, at the time the Hill & Knowlton man handling Kaypro, later protested that he was engaging in standard public relations practice, but his remarks simply dramatized how the welfare of shoppers might clash with that of the manufacturers. Disguised puffery was hardly in keeping with David Kay’s portrayal of himself as a consumer advocate.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Around the time the Kays were calling in high-powered public relations people, Adam Osborne</p>",
  "page-95": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">himself went a step further. In January 1983 he hired a professional manager to be Osborne Computer’s president, Robert Jaunich II, formerly president of Consolidated Foods. Osborne would later blame Jaunich for many of the computer firm’s problems, telling a reporter that Jaunich wasn’t fleet-footed enough for a young company in an industry with a fast-changing market.</p><p>Jaunich’s recollections would differ. Recalling the discoveries he made during the audit before the never-to-take-place public offering of Osborne stock, he told the Wall Street Journal, “Every day you came in, the numbers got worse. Every number you touched went soft.” He blamed the corporate chaos on Adam Osborne. “The real message,” said Jaunich, who resigned as Osborne president in December 1983, “is the professional people got here too late to help.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Osborne was also critical of another executive; he</p>",
  "page-96": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">accused him of cutting a deal with a supplier—while still working at Osborne Computer—to make a rival machine. Whatever happened, the internal squabbles at Osborne may have wasted time and energy that he and colleagues could better have devoted to their battle against the Kaypro.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He himself would later admit in his book Hypergrowth that “new product development moved slowly” until the second half of 1982. A smaller, cheaper Osborne 1, the Vixen, never reached the market while he was running the company. His $2,495 Executive computer—with a seven- rather than five-inch screen—did make it out the door. “Wayne” didn’t. Introduced early enough, Wayne could have given the Kays fits. This $1,995 model was to offer a nine-inch screen and include a built-in printer and a pile of free programs for word processing, communications with other computers, and other tasks. But technical</p>",
  "page-97": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">problems bedeviled Osborne. When Osborne finally caught on that IBM had established a new industry standard, he sought to make his Executive compatible, but he was aware of his own company’s “dismal record in engineering development.”</p><p>Osborne entrusted the task to a San Diego firm. By May 1983, however, Osborne realized that the firm’s IBM-compatible prototypes were “expensive, late, and included wholly unacceptable features such as circles that would be displayed as ovals when an Executive user switched from CP/M to IBM compatibility.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Adam Osborne was clearly losing his sales war with Andy Kay. He had talked to reporters about the Executive in early 1983, and in July newspapers said this had discouraged some dealers from ordering too many Osborne 1s. The story was that Osborne’s cash reserves had fallen as orders for the older machines dropped from 10,000 a month to almost nothing. Apparently</p>",
  "page-98": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he’d forgotten one of the precepts of any business with changing products: you're always competing against yourself. If you make too many old models or brag too soon about the new ones, then you may imperil your cash flow and see surplus product inventory pile up. Your customers will keep their wallets shut as they await your coming attraction. It was a most plausible explanation for Osborne Computer’s 34cash-flow problems but perhaps not the main one. In Hypergrowth Osborne revealed that his sales levels for his Osborne 1 had been dwindling even without all the puffery about the forthcoming Executive model; he confessed that he had lied to the press to throw it “off the scent of the real story.” His bankers were threatening to call in loans; he was laying off workers, yet he still hoped to woo private investors.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As the end neared, Osborne dealers were fighting Kaypro ones with price reductions. An Osborne 1,</p>",
  "page-99": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">discounted, sold for as low as $1,000 by late August 1983. Stores also were dropping the Executive’s price, and with good reason: why so expensive a machine without IBM compatibility right off the bat?</p><p>The first prototypes of the new IBM-compatible Executive weren’t being built until September 1983, or as Osborne later observed, “precisely at the time the company was filing for bankruptcy.”</p><p>The bankruptcy papers showed next to no income and $45 million owed creditors. Newsweek ran a photograph of Osborne leaving his office without a portable computer in sight. Instead, a briefcase was shielding his face, and the caption read: “Founder Osborne exits: IBM was too big.”</p><p>That was somewhat wrong. The IBM-compatibility issue notwithstanding, Kaypro had been Osborne’s main competition.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I’ve always had a great deal of respect for Kaypro,”</p>",
  "page-100": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he would later confess to Popular Computing. “You’ve got to make those statements [knocking the Kaypro]. It makes good copy, damn it.”</p><p>It didn’t make for the best-informed computer buyers, however. Bowled over by Osborne’s marketing campaign and well-publicized disparagement of the competition, some consumers had ignored the information that mattered in the end: the numbers. The screen measurements, disk-drive capacity, almost everything, said the Kaypro was a better computer for common applications. Osborne had faced a moral dilemma. Should he badmouth the competition and help his company survive? Or should he tell the truth—that Brand X was better than his own product? Not surprisingly, Osborne, like any other computer manufacturer, had made the former choice.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In fighting Osborne, Kay had dropped his suggested retail price $200 in May 1983 to $1,595, an indication</p>",
  "page-101": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that small business computers were becoming no more impervious to price wars than the home ones were. He also offered a souped-up version of his II and beefed up his software. His Kaypro IV—the jump from II to IV reflected the substitution of two 400K floppy disk drives for the II’s 200K ones—sold for $1,995.</p><p>Yet another weapon against Osborne was the Kaypro 10, a 35deluxe model with a 10-megabyte hard disk. It sold for $2,795, an amazing deal at the time. A hard disk is an aluminum platter coated with magnetic film, and 10 megabytes is the equivalent of 5,000 double-spaced typewritten pages; yet Kay was selling the computer and software for less than the prices of many hard-disk add-ons.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Adam Osborne,” said Kay, “has said he couldn’t make a portable hard disk because the hard disks are so sensitive to shock. Well, engineering advances are such that hard disks now are capable of being moved. Our</p>",

Another company made the disk itself, and Kaypro had to replace some drives on the early Kaypro 10s. But <em>some</em> glitches were hardly a surprise in any new micro, hard-disk style or floppy. Meanwhile, no less than Control Data, the computer giant, was planning to offer a 5-megabyte hard disk for portables. Already some smaller companies had put out portables with hard disks. And yet Kay, turning out thousands of the machines, was gambling more heavily on their reliability than the others. It could pay, however. New technology might or might not succeed; but in his fast-moving industry, old technology sooner or later would surely fail. To stay alive, he must be among the leaders. More than 150 companies were clawing their way through the micro</p>",
  "page-103": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">business in late 1983, and some analysts believed that fewer than 20 could survive five more years. Many of the 150 had only what one expert called “press release products.” But others were real threats; and without the resources of an IBM or Apple, Kay ideally would fight back through innovation as well as good marketing. He needn’t invent any new micro technology. Yet as a survival-minded “solver of problems,” he had better be prepared to make prompt use of the breakthroughs of others.</p><p>So major risks were ahead—inevitable—as Kay girded for his next fights with the valley.</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-104": "<h3>After The War</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">The Silicon Valley gossips in late 1983 said Adam Osborne was trying science-fiction writing. Then, the next spring, stories suddenly blossomed about his new software company; he bragged that it would be the paperback publisher of the micro world, a mass-market operation that would undercut rivals just as his computer firm had. The name of the new company, in Berkeley, California, was Paperback Software International. And his quotes against competitors were just as colorful as in the old days.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“There’s a helluva lot of software out there,”</p>",
  "page-105": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Osborne told USA Today, “and a lot of it’s overpriced garbage.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He planned to sell his programs at book chains and book racks at less than one-fourth the prices of the Brand Xs. The idea seemed apple-pie admirable, but most people would rather not buy more software than they had time to learn and use; how many hardcore buffs were out there itching to spend hours mastering cheap new programs? Circumstances might change as software becomes easier to use. But could you imagine a Word-Processor-of-the-Month Club or a spreadsheet rack to the right of the gothic romances? No, except for games programs and very cheap enhancements of existing business programs like Lotus 1-2-3, the paperback concept seemed dicey. Even Osborne wasn’t infallible as a seer and market analyst. Once he’d predicted that IBM would fail in the micro market, and hadn’t he been too slow to grasp the importance of</p>",
  "page-106": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">IBM compatibility for his own products? Still, although Osborne Computer Corp. itself had floundered, it had not been for want of the right vision at the company’s inception. His new software enterprise might indeed survive in the proper niche. First, however, he would need capital. In fall 1984 InfoWorld reported that Osborne had paid for a booth at a software show but had not set it up because, for want of funding, his first products weren’t ready. Investors may have shied away due to Osborne’s earlier failure to overcome the classic entrepreneur’s challenge: not just to start a company but keep it prospering.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In shrunken form, with Osborne having resigned as president 37in September 1983, his old company lingered on in early 1984, selling old machines and still promising a new IBM-compatible portable.

  "page-107": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">largest maker of personal computers <em>shipped to stores specializing in them</em>.

The Kays might argue that they wanted to keep expenses down. To the analyst, however, the white tent symbolized amateurish management. In September, Kaypro acknowledged that millions of dollars in computer parts might be missing from the tent and some large trucks; and whatever the cause, theft or bad accounting, the crisis hardly endeared Kaypro to investors. They now could recover only $4 per share—a fraction of the $10 offering price. Around the same time, some angry investors filed lawsuits charging Kaypro with falsely reporting its finances. Kaypro denied this. I hadn’t any idea of the validity of the suits.</p>",
  "page-109": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">An official with Osborne Computers, however, discussing the tent and the general management problems it symbolized, appropriately observed: “It was déjà vu to hear about Kaypro’s inventory situation.”</p><p>Six regional sales managers had left earlier that year for a competitor. Former Kaypro executives griped that the Kays paid too much attention to trivia. Andy Kay even interviewed prospective security guards. Some employees relished this personal touch, but Blair G. Newman, ex-director of marketing and strategic planning, complained to Business Week, “There are too many Kays and not enough pros.” Unconvincingly, a Kaypro spokeswoman 38shrugged off the resignations, saying a small clique of friends had left and plenty of people had lined up to replace them.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Andy Kay’s antipathy toward professional managers was coming back to spook him.

Andy Kay wants to run the company himself. It’s a feudal society there. A lot of employees call it the Kay fiefdom. It’s like a training ground for young knights. You can learn a lot, but it locks you into a rigid structure. There are no changes from the bottom up. That’s the big problem. I don’t know how they get away with calling it ‘participative management.’ Ordinary employees never have any meetings with Kays to discuss major decisions. There’s no checks and balances. If the guy at the top makes a mistake, there’s no way to correct it. No one can call the king’s bluff and stay.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Kays fired someone close to the outspoken</p>",

If marketing men at the large computer companies were so smart, how come Kaypro and Osborne had been the first firms to make portables usable in business? And 39what about all the IBM clones? Couldn’t the marketing men’s me-too-ism have stifled innovation? Then again, another company dominated by engineers—Texas Instruments—had flopped in the home-computer market because it didn’t pay <em>enough</em> heed to marketing.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Kaypro Corporation, at least, still boasted a</p>",
  "page-113": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">dealer network of more than a thousand stores in mid-1984. But some stores in my area had dropped or downplayed the Kaypro line in the earlier part of the year. One reason was that just about all the Kaypro machines were still 8-bit and didn’t run the new IBM-style software. Also, ComputerLand and other big-name chains, a growing part of the business, complained that margins on Kaypros were ten percentage points under competitors and that the machines' software hurt sales of off-the-shelf programs. So ComputerLand shunned Kaypro.</p><p>It was a clear case of the interests of the consumers being at odds with those of the computer dealers. For the Kaypro II at the time was a remarkable bargain; Andy Kay had lowered his <em>retail</em> price in March to $1,295.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">What a contrast to the overpriced PC_jr_ from IBM. Just rumors of the machine—nicknamed the</p>",
  "page-114": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Peanut—had kept the entire industry on edge. It bore the three magic initials. And as the pros said, IBM was compatible with IBM. Only it didn’t work out that way. The PC_jr_, at least the first version, couldn’t run some electronic spreadsheet software and other important programs written for the IBM. The introduction in November 1983 had been anti-climactic in other ways. <em>Jr's</em> little keys were like chiclets, horrors for the touch-typist, and by the time you bought your software and added a second disk drive, you’d be paying hundreds of dollars more. Even after IBM upgraded the PC_jr's_ keyboard in summer 1984 and lowered the price to $999 with one drive, the Kaypro II was still superior for word processing. So were other machines. With two disk drives and WordStar, the Sanyo MBC550—a somewhat IBM-compatible desktop from Japan—listed for just $1,400. Not that the Sanyo lacked limitations of its own.

Not surprisingly, the $995 machine inspired jibes that Kaypro was guilty of using the same gimmickry as IBM and Apple had been with their single-disk computers.</p><p>Moreover, all the Kaypro models, despite their low prices, made <em>some</em> customers pay for their bargains with headaches.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Take Chris Jensen, a writer in Cleveland.

He confirmed another of Jensen’s complaints: that the Kaypro IV model with the modem couldn’t use the most popular communications software at the time. Coincidentally or not—shortly after Jensen griped to me, the New York Times, and computer writer Peter McWilliams—Kaypro released SuprTerm version 5.3. And that did the trick for him. The machine delighted Jensen in other ways, but he still wondered about all the ordinary customers out there who were unwilling or unable to wage a media campaign to get their software up to snuff.</p>",

The Robie looked so ugly—ungainly, plastic cheap, fit for a discount store—that even some value-minded buyers might have thought twice about bringing it into their offices. It was a computer that only a designer could love. And it was just an 8-bit machine.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the 8- versus 16-bit battle, people were accusing Kay of living in the past.

Even with hundreds of thousands of users? What about the ill-fated Osborne? No, computer buyers normally spurned antiques. Within a year or two Andy Kay might change his mind and ponder whether to update the Kaypro II drastically or kill it.</p>",
  "page-119": "<p>In November 1984, well over six months later than Kaypro had promised investors, a 16-bit IBM-compatible machine appeared.</p><p>“He’d rather not call it an IBM clone,” said an industry observer. “He’d rather call it just a 16-bit computer. It’s a matter of pride.”</p><p>The 16-bit model, a portable with a 10-megabyte hard disk and 256K RAM, looked somewhat like the Kaypro II and IV. It had an expansion slot into which you could plug a device to hype up the performance of the machine or expand its versatility; and it offered free WordStar along with other software. At $3,295 it sold for $1,700 less than a hard disk portable from Compaq. But it faced stiff competition from machines such as the hard disk desktop from Leading Edge, which was discounted to as low as $2,000. The 16 just wouldn’t wallop rivals the way the original Kaypro II had.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And it shared some of the drawbacks of the Compaq</p>",
  "page-120": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and many other IBM clones—especially the keyboard. The left shift key was in an awkward position like the IBM PC’s, with a weird, nonalphabetical character separating it and the “Z”; imagine the reaction of touch typists who had enjoyed the Kaypro II’s close resemblance to the traditional Selectric keyboard. Many makers of 16-bit machines had aped the horrid PC keyboard, causing one reviewer to liken them to idiot savante piano players who imitated the mistakes of true geniuses.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The 16, moreover, showed Kaypro’s internal weaknesses. Dan Berger of the San Diego recalled how Kaypro had futilely struggled for more than eight months to design the computer in-house. The project had flopped. Kaypro farmed the design out to a San Diego firm, which did the job in a fraction of the time. Earlier in 1984 Andy Kay had told Berger that Kaypro was spending only 1 percent of revenues on research</p>",
  "page-121": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and development, compared to the industry average of about 10 percent. How frustrated he must have felt paying an outside firm. Osborne had had to do that, but technically Kay had placed himself and his company in a different league.</p><p>Kaypro was heavily depending on the 16. The company hoped it would provide 40 percent of income for the year ending August 31, 1985.</p><p>Early signs were good. A small dealer in Virginia, for instance, The Disk Connection, sold six Kaypro 16s in one week—half to existing Kaypro owners and half to new customers. Some people had demanded an IBM clone, bungled keyboard and all; now Kaypro had given it to them with a vengeance. Appearing late, however, the 16 had lost much of its price advantage. In another six months IBM might well sell its XT hard disk model for as little as the new Kaypro portable.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The 16, if successful, would triumph at a helpful</p>",
  "page-122": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">time. In the 1983 budget year, the company had earned $12.9 million on $75 million in sales; the next budget year it had <em>lost</em> $267,683 on sales of about $120 million—blaming everything from advertising costs to price-cutting and inventory problems. No longer was Kaypro a success story. It remained strong in some stores specializing in computers; but the share of the whole domestic market for personal micros would be 2.5 percent in 1984—a drop from 1983.</p><p>In the long run, moreover, unless Andy Kay made major production changes, his computers might lose what price advantage they did have.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Automation was improving rivals’ quality control and whittling down their labor expenses.

They have a lot of windows, and that’s great for the people—but hard on computer parts. Often people placed piles of parts on the lawn overnight when they didn’t have space elsewhere.” The Kays, to be sure, had put up a semiautomated warehouse designed by Andy’s daughter Janice and built by his son-in-law’s construction firm. “But,” said the ex-Kaypro employee, “that’s not the same as automating the whole plant.” And Andy’s selection of the architect and construction firm was further evidence of the Kays’ tight-grip management style.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This lack of flexibility could especially hurt them in responding to the threat from lap-sized machines with flat screens.

In late 1984 it began marketing the Pivot, a ten-pound, $2,495 MS-DOS portable with one disk drive and a well-reviewed clone of WordStar called NewWord. And a revitalized Osborne—on the verge of escaping the Chapter XI bankruptcy proceedings—would soon sell its own version of the machine.</p>",
  "page-126": "<p>Data General, the mini-maker written up in the best-seller Soul of a New Machine, was another threat to Kaypro. In September 1984 it unveiled the Data General/One, which offered IBM compatibility, a built-in 737K floppy disk drive, and a 25-line flat screen. A software developer joked that the letters on the screen were so faint that the machine should be sold with a coal miner’s hat to read it. But eventually the flat screen would be just as readable as the Kaypro’s cathode ray tube. With the inevitable price drops and refinements, machines like the Pivot and the Data General/One would wreak havoc on Kaypro sales unless Kay retaliated with the right flat-screen portable of his own. IBM, AT&T, and Compaq, too, were designing their own flat-screen machines.

His mother worked as a clerk. “My first job,” Rubinstein said, “was a helper on a fruit truck when I was twelve years old.” Two years later, however, his neighbors were “letting me ruin their radios,” and by his mid-twenties, he seemed settled into the routine of a TV repairman.</p><p>But Rubinstein grew restless after six months’ reserve military duty in the 1950s; he attended night school at Brooklyn College and took up technical writing.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Decades later he recalled a navigational computer he encountered while a civilian, speaking as if it were his “Rosebud,” as if he were Charles Kane thinking about</p>",
  "page-139": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the Colorado snows and the name on his childhood sled. He gave me the machine’s exact measurements, eight by nine by twelve inches. Then, mixing nostalgia with awe, he said, “If you opened it up, it would look like a Swiss watchmaker’s nightmare, all those gears and little electronic things whirring and clicking away. But with it you could take off from an aircraft carrier and circle overhead and press the reset button and fly anywhere you wanted, and wherever you flew, 49an indicator kept track of how far you were from that spot on the ocean and told how you could return.” Ask Rubinstein about his early career and you may hear more talk of machines than of people. “$2” The hardware, however, helped make the man.

  "page-150": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the word-processing world, Barnaby worked in a spare bedroom from which he evicted an electric-train set. He wrote the WordStar with a brand-new IMSAI computer, 64K RAM, two 530K disks. His big, fat Teletype Model 40 printer crawled along at a pokey 10 characters per second, but he poured out his code as if he were a muse-inspired novelist.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Working out whatever it was he was going to code,” Rubinstein recalled, “he would sit in front of the machine and his fingers would fly. And he would actually growl at the machine with his chin jutted out—<em>rrr, rrr</em>, like that—and he would pound the keys as fast as he could go, because he couldn’t get into the machine fast enough.” Between fall 1978 and summer 1979 Barnaby typically worked eighteen hours a day on WordStar, and sometimes many more in the frenzy of it all. Rubinstein said, “I stayed up a few nights with him, in fact. He was younger than I was—still is,” he said</p>",
  "page-151": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">dryly, “so I couldn’t do it as much as he could. He was an excellent coder, one of the best I’ve ever seen in terms of speed and accuracy and putting in features that are real clever.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Barnaby, in turn, praises Rubinstein’s contributions to WordStar. “Seymour set the general goals. I wouldn’t have known what the world wanted because I’m not in touch with the world. He gave me a lot of specifics. He was probably the person who used WordStar the most and gave me the most comments, because he bridges the range from being able to understand where technical people’s heads are at and being able to relate to the outside world and the market. He was a programmer years ago. He’s familiar with the process I go through. He doesn’t like to do it anymore, but he sort of understands what I’m doing. I think the menus were his idea”—the instructions that pop up on the screen if the typist takes too much time to execute a WordStar</p>",
  "page-152": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">command. Rubinstein also recalls contributing touches like the Q effect, which accelerates the impact of other WordStar commands; and he says he thought up the dotted lines that cross the screen to mark page breaks. No matter who did what for WordStar, however, it’s likely that Barnaby, regardless of Rubinstein’s helpful studies of the market, was writing mostly for Barnaby. “I don’t hear a voice from the world,” he generalized to me about his coding habits. “I hear a voice from the back of my head.”</p><p>Rob Barnaby, you might say, was WordStar’s first user. He used WordStar as a programming aid</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As we talked, I realized how close his working habits came to mine and how, coding WordStar for himself and Rubinstein, he had also programmed it for me. It was not so much a fluke that the program’s logic coincided with mine. So, in many ways, did Barnaby’s personal writing habits. “I fiddle around a lot with</p>",
  "page-153": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">text,” he said. “I try to get the points down, and then I try to get good sentences to say them with. If I find I try to word the thing right from the start, I lose it. I must see things on the screen.” Amen, Rob. I don’t write my best English inside my head, either; I, too, must <em>see</em>. Like me, Barnaby might have loathed the programs that didn’t let you zip the cursor to an error and correct it without much ado.</p><p>The creation of WordStar, by the way, wasn’t the only act of genius from MicroPro. The name was a marketer’s dream. Why “WordStar”?</p><p>MicroPro already had the programmer’s aid called WordMaster, and Rubinstein apparently held an informal name-this-product contest for the new word processor.</p><p>“Who’s this for?” asked an employee named Barbara.</p><p>“It’s really for the production-minded secretary,” he replied.</p>",
  "page-154": "<p>“Why don’t you call it Word—?” she said, using a vulgar synonym for “cat.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Barbara mulled it over. “Maybe that’s a little too risqué. But you say the secretary’s the hero?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Rubinstein.</p><p>“The star?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then why not call it WordStar?”</p><p>And so it was.</p><p>Hitting the marketplace in the summer of 1979, the product clicked; no competitor came close; at least none offered WordStar’s get-what-you-see printing features.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rubinstein had come out with good, timely software, and now he was riding the beginnings of the micro wave. Just as with VisiCalc, buyers soon asked about WordStar by name—before they bought their computers. In fact, often it was <em>why</em> they bought</p>",
  "page-155": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">micros. And Rubinstein found WordStar wasn’t merely a good first sale for dealers. Frequently, it would be a second. Balking at WordStar’s price, customers would make do with an inferior word processor but remember the sales reps’ original praise of the MicroPro program.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Ironically, as WordStar was taking off, Barnaby, its writer, was headed toward another burnout. The atmosphere around MicroPro 55was changing. Rubinstein, who eventually would name a yacht the <em>MicroStar</em> and move into a hilltop home with a sunken tile tub, was losing touch with some programmers. “They locked us up in this little windowless room with Customer Support,” recalled Jim Fox, Barnaby’s former assistant, who worked on WordStar Version 3.0, the one I’m using. “It was messy. It was very noisy—not very good air circulation. And then they were expecting us to do programming. Rob asked months and months for shelves, and they never gave them until he threw a</p>",
  "page-156": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">temper tantrum.” It seemed strange for Rubinstein to let this happen. Everyone agrees that $400,000 home or not, he was the opposite of a golf-course president. And yet Rubinstein had burdened MicroPro with high-tech bureaucrats who were turning it into a mini-Washington, inflicting reorganization after reorganization. The real producers, whether sales reps or programmers, sometimes suffered. Barnaby quit in the summer of 1980 just after working on an important sister program of WordStar, MailMerge, which helps businesses personalize letters with names plugged in from mail lists. “To my knowledge,” Rubinstein told me in early 1983, “he has not coded anything of significance since.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Rubinstein was telling the truth as he knew it. Barnaby, indeed, had largely forgotten about computers. He had lost excess weight; he had traveled; he had stopped smoking and shaved off his beard. In</p>",
  "page-157": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">superficial ways he seemed a different man from the writer of WordStar. And yet Barnaby had left software before and returned; and in late 1982, unknown to Rubinstein apparently, he had again.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It wasn’t just that he needed the money. He could no longer flee computerdom so easily. A barrier had tumbled, the one between his work and the rest of the world. Once micros had been mostly hobbyists’ toys, demanding hours of soldering and programming. Many of his friends hadn’t fathomed what he did. But now Barnaby was hearing a woman—formerly perplexed—say that WordStar was the rage at the stores where she was shopping for her new business computer. Barnaby’s father got 2010 for Christmas and read that Arthur Clarke had written it with WordStar; Clarke had sent the book to New York on a five-inch floppy and transmitted final corrections from Sri Lanka through his computer over a satellite link. Another</p>",
  "page-158": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">science-fiction leader, I discovered, also was hoping to catch up with 2010—Seymour Rubinstein.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Returned to computers, bearded again, Barnaby in early 1983 was working for a small rival of MicroPro, Chang Laboratories, aiming at the lucrative market for software compatible with IBM’s 16-bit PC. He was like a canny Hollywood scriptwriter. Barnaby was somewhat vague about his software plans, in part because he really did not know what he would create in the end, but perhaps 56also because he did not want to alert the competition. He would not, in early 1983, say he was working on a new word processor, only that he was at the keyboard of his new IBM. It ran WordStar. Barnaby, like thousands of other people, had bought his IBM version at a local ComputerLand store. You might say it was the neat completion of a circle, for the founder of the ComputerLand chain was none other than Bill Millard, the man behind IMSAI, Barnaby’s</p>",
  "page-159": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">former employer.</p><p>Barnaby offered his opinion of the WordStar version he had bought at ComputerLand—competent but unimaginative. Well, how could he outdo his WordStar? Barnaby answered, and despite his refusal to be pinned down on a future project (“It could be a spreadsheet”), he gave at least an inkling of what another word processor from him could be like.</p><p>Among other things, Barnaby would take advantage of the newer machines’ more powerful memories; he’d write more instructions for the RAM. So he wouldn’t have to choose as much between making the program either (1 more easily understood or (2 capable of moving around words in the fastest or most efficient way. Smart computers and dumb humans could coexist more gracefully. ) )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Also, he’d reduce the number of commands in WordStar, a good idea if not overdone. “I’ve thought,</p>",
  "page-160": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Gee, couldn’t I have only two or three ways of deleting text rather than twenty. And I look at my habits, and I do use a lot of them. But most of them I could replace with the same number of keystrokes or only one more keystroke using a combination of other commands. I’d never tried to write a program where you didn’t have to read the manual before. And I still don’t think I’ve succeeded. I think that’s a worthy goal for the future—to write a program that doesn’t have to have a manual.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Back at MicroPro, Rubinstein, by early 1983, had fallen behind some previous goals of his own. Fewer than 250 people worked for the company, or less than half the peak number, and the company had saddled itself earlier with hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in office leases it no longer needed. “There were some odd things that happened internally with these visions of increasing numbers of sales,” said a former MicroPro man, “and they hired too many people too</p>",
  "page-161": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">quickly. They pay very well, and their salesmen were getting incredible commissions. I know one guy—his first month in sales he took home five grand in commissions.” Did he sustain that amount? “He didn’t,” said the ex-MicroPro employee. “Every month after that he fell.” And so, it seemed, did the sales rep’s colleagues at MicroPro. “They kept trying to break record after record,” the former employee recalled, 57“and the only way to do it was to extend generous credit and get their products out the door.... They had to produce all the programs people ordered, but they weren’t getting their money immediately.” With high interest rates, some buyers would stall payments as long as possible. MicroPro’s growth problems weren’t unique. Another pioneer in micro software, Lifeboat Associates, a distributor, also found itself overexpanded and laid off employees.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">MicroPro likewise suffered when programmers,</p>",
  "page-162": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ordered to meet Rubinstein’s deadline, cut corners on an early version of WordStar for the IBM PC. The software was too hard to adapt to customers’ printers. And then IBM threw MicroPro a loop. It suddenly changed the PC’s operating system in a way that made WordStar glitch up. MicroPro wasn’t the culprit here. And yet it was the one receiving angry phone calls from frustrated customers. It was, in a sense, a victim of its own reputation for quality. MicroPro products had bugs like other software makers’, but fewer of them than most, so that the IBM WordStar problems—since corrected—enraged customers with high expectations.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Old friends of Rubinstein’s, meanwhile, complained that the firm had nothing truly original coming out, that MicroPro had evolved from a programming company to a marketing one. I disagreed somewhat. MicroPro had succeeded largely <em>because</em> Rubinstein had aggressively sold himself and his programs. And yet it</p>",
  "page-163": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was also true no other MicroPro product had commanded as much attention as WordStar, the first big one. Michael Canyes, a computer consultant, complained that it was “getting a little gray around the temples.” It was time for updates, drastic ones. If they didn’t come, if competitors kept duplicating various features of WordStar, the program would eventually perish.</p><p>So far, however, that hadn’t happened.</p><p>Nothing had appeared that was both as good as WordStar and marketed as successfully.</p><p>“If you’d asked me when I first introduced it,” Barnaby said, “I would have said as soon as we stopped moving, somebody would have done something better. I sort of thought WordStar would be gone by now, but it’s growing instead. It may sell a million by the time it’s done.” He wasn’t bragging; he was right.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">We were talking now in summer 1983. Barnaby had</p>",
  "page-164": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">removed himself from the payroll of Chang Laboratories, and I suspected it might be because he worried about living up to his first success. Barnaby didn’t discourage that impression. When asked if another WordStar might be on its way, he said, “I hit once; I may not hit again.” I understood. He was no different from a writer trying to create another blockbuster book or movie; he would be competing against himself—a contest made more difficult by the fact that 58MicroPro’s marketing expertise would no longer be on his side. I suggested that he and Rubinstein might both benefit by working together again as a team. If Barnaby agreed, though, he certainly didn’t make that clear to me, and I hung up thinking that the Barnaby-Rubinstein collaboration was as dead as the Welles-Mankiewicz one.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Let’s just put it this way,” said Barnaby of MicroPro. “They could have made me happier there</p>",
  "page-165": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and I’d still be there, and MicroPro would still be growing instead of being flat.”</p><p>“Rob is beloved around here,” said a public relations woman at MicroPro when I suggested that the company might benefit from his return, “but we have many other good programmers.”</p><p>Not long afterward I was talking to Seymour Rubinstein. He was decidedly more upbeat about MicroPro’s fortune than Barnaby had been. He had added some fifty people to his staff since we’d last talked. Rubinstein predicted record sales of about $42 million in 1983, of which WordStar would be 65 percent; he expected that his word processor would thrive inside the ROMs of $1,500 lap-sized computers.</p><p>During our conversation I expressed my astonishment over a newspaper article; supposedly, a programmer—unnamed—had dreamed up WordStar in a week or so during vacation.</p>",
  "page-166": "<p>“I was amazed to see it myself,” Rubinstein said. “It was really romanticizing something in a way that wasn’t necessary, beyond not being true.”</p><p>“I talked to Barnaby,” I said, “and he has the normal worries of programmers and writer-writers—whether he can ever repeat his success. And I still wonder about the chances of you two coming together again.”</p><p>“Well,” Rubinstein said without the slightest pause, “I got him back working again.”</p><p>“Now?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“Just started a week and a half ago.”</p><p>“Christ,” I said, “I sort of popped the question to him.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I’d just as soon you didn’t broadcast it,” Rubinstein said. “He’s not in solid yet, but I expect he will be. You can put in there a blurb that as of this writing Barnaby</p>",
  "page-167": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">came back for a test run to see whether he could get involved again.”</p><p>“As a WordStar user,” I said, “I have a selfish interest in his developing it further. Will he be working on WordStar?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“He’ll be working on WordStar,” said Rubinstein. Like a movie man, he excitedly described his coming attraction. (“It’ll just knock their socks off.” The new WordStar would contain a spreadsheet. 59Also, used with the right printers, it would offer proportional spacing, meaning that an “I” would take up less room than a “W,” making the print look more booklike. What’s more, the new WordStar would be simpler to learn. Listening to Rubinstein raving over his forthcoming word processor, I could tell that if Barnaby didn’t work out on the new project, MicroPro might use someone else. Ideally, however, it wouldn’t. “Just incredible,” Rubinstein had said of Barnaby’s coding of</p>",

In fact, he had helped fit WordStar into the little memory of the Epson lap-sized portable marketed that year. A micro magazine, meanwhile, came out with a report that a version of WordStar for big machines, Version 4.0, might contain split screens. In October 1984, however, I was still waiting. And Rob Barnaby had left MicroPro in July.</p><p>“Things didn’t click,” he said without going into the specifics. “We talked about a lot of things, but they didn’t jell.” He was now consulting.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">MicroPro suffered in other ways.

  "page-183": "<p>“No contest,” proclaimed a San Francisco Examiner columnist in one ad in 1982, looking up from his Xerox 820, dangling a pair of glasses from his hand, like some refugee from a Famous Writers School. “Select was easier to learn.” The ads didn’t say what he was comparing it to, but a popular computer magazine named his equivalent of Brand X, WordStar.</p><p>The columnist, Dick Nolan, never returned my calls, and Select wouldn’t put me in touch with the secretary featured in another ad, but I did track down “Richard Russell, Gentleman Farmer.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Nebraska soybeans,” said the ad, “are Richard Russell’s business. But he rarely gets there. Richard manages his farms from a Victorian flat in San Francisco. And he does it with little more 66than a telephone and the SELECT Word Processor.” What was this, an ad for a word processor or a communications program? And yet the copywriter had</p>",
  "page-184": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">done her job. I read on eagerly, curious about gentlemanly word processors—human or disk. “Select supports his interests as efficiently and often more quickly than could a well-run office back home. The briefest bank instructions or thickest annual report can be recorded in minutes and retrieved in seconds.” Was software so powerful? Maybe. The ad quoted Russell: “Select manages the business. I just reap the harvest.”</p><p>The gentleman farmer, however, wasn’t mainly a gentleman farmer—rather, an interior decorator.</p><p>“I spend more time doing that,” Russell told me when I called up out of the blue, “than on my farm operation, which is managed in the Midwest.”</p><p>Then why be a gentleman farmer in the ad?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I think they just thought the idea of a gentleman farmer was more interesting than an interior designer,” Russell said. It must have been. He was deluged with calls, including one from NBC, which was in the thick</p>",
  "page-185": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of a computer series.</p><p>Well, I asked, did he actually use the word processor?</p><p>Yes, Russell said, but mainly in his designing business. It was a successful one, 20 percent commercial, 80 percent residential, including work on some mansions in the million-dollar range. “I design architectural interiors, furniture, fabrics,” he said, “the whole thing.”</p><p>What did he most like about Select?</p><p>“The self-teaching program was the main thing that appealed to me,” he said—the tutorial disk.</p><p>I asked Russell about the cumbersome series of keystrokes that the Kaypro version of Select inflicted on people making insertions a few sentences back in their writing.</p><p>He knew about the problem. And he knew about WordStar, too.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I’m a lot more aware of that since the ad ran,” he</p>",
  "page-186": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">said of WordStar’s reputation as a powerful word-processing system, “but I don’t think I’m in a position to say much about it since I gave Select my endorsement. But you’ve brought up some valid points. The whole business of personal computers is new to me in the last six months, and so I’m learning about it, as well.” Russell said he used Select several hours a week, that he could legitimately endorse it even if he wasn’t actually using it mainly as a gentleman farmer. He was right. I didn’t question his basic sincerity. But for me, anyway, Select had proved tediously cumbersome.</p><p>In early 1983 I called up Martin Dean, the head of Select Information Systems, and did the proper thing.</p><p>“Martin,” I said in effect, “I hate your software.”</p><p>Why gladhand information out of him, then stab him in the back?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Dean was smart and a good sport. Not only didn’t he hang up on me; he spent an hour on the phone</p>",
  "page-187": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">giving his point of view. Like the developer of WordStar, Dean had a philosophy, one born of his own business experiences—in this case, a WordStar debacle. He was a real estate lawyer eager for one of his staffers to work with a sophisticated word processor. “I handed her WordStar,” he told me, “and said, ‘It’s the standard in the industry.’ And she came back two days later and said she was not going to do that.”</p><p>“She was vehement,” Dean said. She wasn’t going to spend the seventy hours she felt it would take to master WordStar.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And she wasn’t “just” a secretary. She had a year of law school, had done ten years of legal secretarial work, and was supervising Dean’s legal research staff. “She’s one of the brightest women I’ve worked with in the legal business,” he said. “But she didn’t have the time to learn WordStar.” A major manufacturer had done a study comparing the two word processors’ learning</p>",
  "page-188": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">time. “And my understanding,” said Dean, “is they determined it takes about fifty hours of working with WordStar to become as accomplished as you could become in ninety minutes of using Select.” I disagreed. WordStar took much less time for me to learn; Select, much more. With other people, it might be the reverse, but a good company normally wouldn’t have so much turnover that the employees would lack time to master a <em>decent</em> word processor.</p><p>Defending Select, Dean praised the tutorial disk and the program’s built-in memory aids. Want to erase? If you hit the “Escape” control and pressed the “E,” you’d eventually do that. Eventually. Dean and I went through a keystroke count. He claimed that actually his system—improved since the one I’d tried—was as fast or faster than rivals if run on the right machines. He said the Kaypro just wasn’t right for his program.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“If you felt this way,” I asked, “how come you let it</p>",
  "page-189": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">be bundled with the Kaypro?” Why did he and the Kaypro’s maker sign a contract that allowed Select to be the “free” word processor provided with the computer?</p><p>“Well,” Dean said, “we had that version on the market only three months”—in 1982. Then, according to him, Perfect Writer underpriced Select. “Kaypro <em>then</em> thought that was a bargain. They do not now.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Try to get a call through to their service department.” He was right. Kaypro owners were swapping war stories. Theoretically, Kaypro—not Perfect—would guide the owners through the software 68maze. Actually, it didn’t. Not always, anyway. I heard people at user groups deciding which machine to lie about owning so the Perfect Writer staffers would listen to their problems. Kaypro, in fact, dropped Perfect software in 1984 after dealers said they preferred WordStar.</p>",
  "page-190": "<p>Okay, but what about my printer not underlining with the Kaypro using Select?</p><p>Here again, Dean blamed Kaypro, and the printer maker, too, but I wasn’t about to zero in on who was at fault here. All I knew was that my daisy wheel wasn’t that exotic a machine. And yet, involuntarily, I’d been sold cumbersome software that, unmodified, did not even work right with the other parts of my $2,500 investment.</p><p>You may love Select, maybe even after you’ve been running it a while. “Cumbersome,” remember, is my opinion. A Washington Post staffer named Eugene Meyer, a Kaypro owner, liked Select and said the slowness “gives me more time to think.” He was working on a book around the same time I was and turned out one as long. “But,” I half joked, “if you’d been using WordStar, then you might have written one <em>three</em> times longer than mine.”</p>",
  "page-191": "<p>I called up Ben Shneiderman, an expert on matches between humans and software systems. Just what did an academic feel about Select-style systems and WordStar? Shneiderman, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Maryland and author of Software Psychology: Human Factors in Computer and Information Systems, said:</p><p>“Select has very few commands. There are very different people in the world. You’re very attracted to choice and options, and you seek the power that WordStar offers. But very simply, people are different. Some like to drive Maseratis, and some like to go twenty miles per hour.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He was right. There might even be a version of Select better than today’s WordStar; software is constantly changing, and when you shop, you must do your homework to make sure you’re buying the best program available for your needs at the time. But while</p>",
  "page-192": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">I was writing this book, I loathed Select—even a version more advanced than the one for my Kaypro.</p><p>Who, anyway, wanted to hire a typist content to do the keyboard equivalent of twenty miles per hour?</p><p>And yet I tried to be tolerant. I hit the control key to fire up WordStar’s commands; Select users tapped “Escape.” “There are twenty-five thousand people happy with using ‘Escape’ instead of the control key,” Dean had told me, as patiently as a liberal Baptist explaining to a Klansman that Jews didn’t have horns.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Certainly it was true: one man’s joy, another man’s plastic-disked 69kludge—that was software for you. And what you learned first was often your first love. A computer magazine even called one article “Getting Married to WordStar.” “Can you erase your memory modules?” Mark Robinson, a marketing man with Lexisoft, asked before he mailed me a copy of his company’s Spellbinder word processor. He had a point.</p>",
  "page-193": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">I liked Spellbinder more than Select, much more, because it ran faster on the Kaypro, but I still could not abide by the need to enter a new mode to make insertions or corrections. It seemed inhibiting, this requirement, though perhaps more in writing than in secretarial work. Michael Canyes, a computer consultant, at the time loved Palantir. It offered many of the better features of both WordStar and Spellbinder and let a nonprogrammer set up the numbers pads of many computers to serve as function keys. Canyes also appreciated The Final Word, an excellent word processor for footnoting and other academic requirements. It was clear. There were serious alternatives to WordStar—some, anyway—even if, like the writer of the “Married” article, I was already well matched.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In some ways, however, I felt uncomfortable about the general direction in which the software business</p>",
  "page-194": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">seemed to be moving. Would less powerful but well-marketed products like Select drive out the future WordStars?</p><p><em>The</em> WordStar had benefited from Seymour Rubinstein’s salesmanship. But Rubinstein also had boasted a solid computer background; and unlike some of the new people in software, he wasn’t just a businessman cashing in on an exploding market.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Again and again a pattern was beginning to repeat itself. Programmer-entrepreneurs would tough it out in the proverbial garages—for some reason programmers work in garages, authors in garrets—and score with the right software hit. Propelled by little more than their drive and technical expertise, their companies would grow. Then, however, other businessmen, real businessmen, would want the same niche, and the marketing people would muscle in and set the tone. Or, as with some new companies, they might have been</p>",
  "page-195": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">setting the tone from the very start.</p><p>This had been the classic pattern in many industries—Orville and Wilbur Wright hadn’t exactly gone on to become major aviation magnates—but computers were improving faster than had airplanes. And so the process was accelerated; well-financed managers were rapidly replacing garage-style entrepreneurs.</p><p>The stakes were higher, and striking back, software authors were even hiring agents. The question arose, however, of the extent to which the market would remain open to more imaginative garage people, anyway, what with increased use of teams to develop complex programs.</p><p>“The frontier,” said Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Soft.letter, an industry publication, “is already closing.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“A couple of years ago you got to be successful primarily by competently executing an innovative idea and by picking the right machine to produce that</p>",
  "page-196": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">execution for. VisiCalc for the Apple is the classic example here, but lots of other programs achieved success on a smaller scale by doing something useful for a microcomputer that came to dominate a market niche”—or, I would add with WordStar in mind, by producing a program valuable for its very ability to run on a number of machines.</p><p>“Now, however,” Tarter said, “the rules are changing.... Marketing factors are becoming more important. You have to package and distribute the product with far greater sophistication than before and be able to spend the kind of money that sophistication requires.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“It’s like the record business,” said Nick Vergis, then a marketing man with Perfect Software, telling me about the new programs his company was developing. “You get a lot more bullets ready than you actually fire. Some will be hits, and some won’t. You hope you’ll get</p>",
  "page-197": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">enough hits to pay for the new bullets.” Research and development (R & D was a major part of the costs of new programs. The original WordStar had come cheaply; Rob Barnaby had toiled night and day for a fraction of the money that his counterparts now often demanded. )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then again, advertising and other non-R & D expenditures in the industry had increased, too. By spring 1984 Select had sold 50,000 copies. That should have been enough to sustain a small or medium-sized software company, but even after a public stock offering in November 1983, Dean still felt capital-short. “We just couldn’t spend enough on ads and still have money to pay the sales force,” said Dean, who “saw it coming” by February 1984. That summer he licensed Select to Intelligent Systems to publish and promote at the retail level. Intelligent, privately held and based in Georgia, enjoyed yearly sales of $90 million; its Quadram</p>",
  "page-198": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">subsidiary made well-advertised computer accessories. In late 1984 Select merged with Summa Software Corp., an Oregon firm that offered a stock-market program called Winning on Wall Street, and Dean laid off six marketing people from Select, so that his original firm had only twenty-one workers left. The Intelligent deal went on despite the merger.</p><p>“There are many more products available today than the market can support, and it’s very confusing to consumers,” said an Intelligent vice-president named Frank Marks. “The</p><p>To Select Information Systems’ credit, the company had garnered some favorable reviews of new products in the months before the Quadsoft deal. (They included Select Write, a $99 stripped-down Select. Even so, some of the old-time micro people correctly questioned Dean’s style of “user friendliness.” )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In a Byte article, “Simplify, Simplify, Simplify,”</p>",
  "page-199": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Dean had pushed menu-driven software like Select.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Wasn’t that stretching it, however? If you ate at the same restaurant day after day, couldn’t you order many kinds of meals without bothering to glance at a menu? How would you feel about a waitress who <em>insisted</em> you see a menu even if the fare never changed? She would be pushy, wouldn’t she? All of a sudden “user friendliness” would be antiuser pushiness to those using a program regularly. Strictly menu-driven software should normally be just for occasional users, children, and adults wanting to be treated like children; and many if not most adults in the business world worked too often with words and numbers to let Select-style programs keep them in the infant stage. Granted, exceptions existed justifying this kind of software. A micro user who occasionally retrieved information from a mainframe, for instance, could take advantage of menus to guide him through complicated routines. What’s</p>",
  "page-200": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">more, even WordStar employed a menu to handle installation procedures to match the program up with various computers and printers. But that was different from menus that slowed you during your regular work with the program.</p><p>Some of the so-called command-driven programs, moreover—at least WordStar—actually did have the option of letting you keep a list of common commands on the screen if you wanted.</p><p>Jerry Pournelle, a prominent computer columnist, growled back at the “user friendliness” crowd, saying that their software didn’t let ordinary people enjoy the full power of their machines. “It takes a little work to join the micro revolution,” he said, “but the rewards can be high.”</p><hr class=\"section\">",

Boland, a graying, middle-aged accountant, is just as useful to Clinton Cycles as a top mechanic or a crack Suzuki salesman.</p><p>Above all, a good controller obviously knows where the money is. He helps his employer avoid unneeded trips to the bank to borrow more. Clinton Cycles, in fact, borrows rarely.</p>",
  "page-204": "<p>That’s one reason why, when U.S. motorcycle sales suffered the economic equivalent of a head-on crash, Clinton survived. The firm even expanded during the early 1980s. Also, years before, owner Don Smolinski had wisely diversified. Clinton Cycles was actually Clinton Cycle and Salvage, Inc., a miniconglomerate with three motorcycle stores and dealings in scrap metal. Sales exceeded several million a year.</p><p>But size and complexity weren’t pure joy. Boland’s accounting software just couldn’t handle a holding company and five subsidiaries, 74not without costly customizing, and nearly a year after computerization, his feelings were still mixed.</p><p>“I don’t regret the decision,” Boland said. But at the time he had spent thousands of dollars more than planned, and he told me, “There’s been a few times I would have thrown this computer out the door in a second.”</p>",
  "page-205": "<p>His horror story—even if it eventually turns into a success tale, as it probably will—is instructive. He’s good. And he bought his software from a good store. Clinton Computers, in the same Maryland suburb, won top ratings in a consumer guide in the Washington, D.C., area. A software executive, moreover, an outspoken one critical of some other D.C. dealers, praised Clinton.</p><p>So a bothersome issue arises. If a $3,800 accounting program doesn’t work out easily with good people selling and using it, what happens among mediocre people?</p><p>And there is a second point here. Don’t expect even the best computer store to serve as your private consultant, intimately familiar with your business; not, at least, unless you’re buying a big mini or mainframe from the likes of IBM.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A third point, too, comes through. Don’t</p>",
  "page-206": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">computerize a multi-million-dollar business without a consultant—at least not if you’re running an extra-hairy program like an accounting one—unless you’re willing to talk and think computerese or at least take a training course. Accounting software, anyway, just isn’t simple and reliable enough yet. Any idiot can flick on a computer and stuff a floppy disk into a drive or crank up a hard disk; most of the time his hardware will work fine, but even the brightest of businessmen may need a consultant to unravel the mysteries of many programs—even “canned,” off-the-shelf accounting packages like the one that bedeviled Ed Boland.</p><p>A blunt, tough-talking man, Boland himself is no moron. He holds a bachelors degree in accounting, and he’s worked for employers ranging from hospitals to restaurant chains, including one where he caught a chef on the take from a supplier.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Accounting is accounting,” he said. “I don’t care if</p>",
  "page-207": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">it’s food or motorcycles. Life exists the same way.” Moreover, life is a series of ratios, of intertwining figures. That’s how Boland caught the chef. He knew that food costs were normally 20 percent of the company’s expenses; two months after the chef’s hiring, they were 23 percent, creeping up toward 27 percent, finally. The incident perhaps colored his attitude toward computerization. He would computerize, but not overdo it, not lose himself in tangential statistics, not hire extra clerks to key in data.</p><p>“We carry more than seventy thousand new parts <em>numbers</em> alone,” he said. “Seventy thousand different kinds of screws, bolts, nuts, 75fenders, rims.” But if he couldn’t track every single bolt, he at least could work with major numbers like sales figures for various categories.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Normally, for instance, new bike sales and accessories sales went up and down together, and if one</p>",
  "page-208": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of the two had fallen off alone, you could bet that Boland would demand a reason. If nothing else, computers, by making past information available more quickly, could help him sniff out trouble.</p><p>Computerizing, he saw a micro as one way to avoid greedy consultants and their expensive recommendations.</p><p>“I’ve seen too many instances,” said Boland, “where businesses paid out $50,000, $60,000 to a consultant who spent six or seven months analyzing computer requirements. Then he’d recommend $50,000 or $150,000 worth of computer equipment.” Boland wanted the benefits of the bigger machines without the costs. His goal was to reach the point that a somewhat larger competitor in the D.C. area already had; the rival owned an IBM 34 system with a six-digit price.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“He used to work for IBM fifteen or twenty years ago, before he went into the motorcycle business,”</p>",
  "page-209": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Boland said. “He now has just about every one of his salespeople on commission, and he knows exactly what they sell every day. He can tell you where each motorcycle, each piece of inventory, is.</p><p>“He can tell you whether it’s in a truck, what color it is, where it is, what stage of preparation it’s in for delivery. He puts his purchases in the computer with an inventory program. The moment a salesman sells a cycle, the register itself deducts it from inventory. It’s a point-of-sales system. So theoretically, at the end of the day he knows exactly what he started the day with, what he sold, what he added to it, and what the bottom-line figure is. We’d love to get to that point.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“The likelihood of this happening with us, though, is very low. I don’t know if all this detail is necessary. And our business is seasonal, and I don’t want too much cash tied up in the system. And what’s the sense of keeping instant track of every nut and bolt sold? But</p>",
  "page-210": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">we’d love to get the major items in on computer. The motorcycles, for instance. They can easily sell for up to $6,000 apiece, so it’s worth it.</p><p>“It’s a question of software. This competitor has spent more than $100,000 to develop specific software to get what he wants. Now if you’ve got $100,000 to throw away and want to hire a programmer full time at, say, 0,000 a year, that’s fine. Most companies like us can’t afford that.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So Boland bought several programs off the shelf from Clinton Computers, including Accounting Plus, which he began trying to 76use as an electronic general ledger. He ran it on a North Star computer with a 5-megabyte hard disk—a memory device capable of stashing away the equivalent of maybe 2,500 typed pages of information. The North Star system was just a way for him to get his feet wet in computing with a general-ledger program. Boland, though, would switch</p>",
  "page-211": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">computers even sooner than expected. The system’s memory space wouldn’t suffice for the records of his miniconglomerate, and it wasn’t easily expandable. And he would have trouble getting the machine repaired as quickly as he needed. Clinton Computers, however good its service department, just could not respond fast enough to suit <em>his</em> requirements.</p><p>And the software seemed just as major a disappointment, what with the need for complicated customization.</p><p>“The biggest problem I ran into at the store,” he said of the hardware and software, “was ‘We’re going to sell you a system that we think will do the job, but not necessarily so.’”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Both the buyer and the seller, in this case, apparently lost the software gamble; they apparently came out on the wrong side of “necessarily.” Clinton Computers did not win, because it <em>isn’t</em> a fly-by-night operation.</p>",
  "page-212": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Boland’s name had come to me from none other than Sue Grothoff, who’d sold him the software. She had enough confidence in herself and her store to offer Boland as the source of a “candid” story, and my respect remains, especially after having talked to another business customer, raving happy about her ability to understand his company’s software needs.</p><p>Boland emphasized that Clinton wasn’t out to cheat him. “Sue is a very nice person.” And he liked the software expert there, too. “He knows how to change software, but you have one person trying to meet the needs of too many customers. He’s spread too thin. Clinton never gave him enough time to get the program running at my business. And we never could seem to get together to get the twelve hours of training they’ve promised me. To be frank, I think we spent the twelve hours trying to correct the problem I had rather than on training.”</p>",
  "page-213": "<p>Giving Clinton Computer’s side, Grothoff said, “Because of changes that Ed wanted in the software, it took longer to adapt the program to meet his needs. And that used up the twelve hours.” Evidently, Boland and Grothoff stayed on good terms, because she later sold him a new Kaypro portable for home use.</p><p>But with his big computer system at work, Boland—for one reason or another—seems to have suffered more than his share of woes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Accounting Plus,” said Boland of the software he bought there, “is a very good program, but it was designed for one single company to be subdivided into departments. You could have six 77departments, everything from sales to used parts, and it will work beautifully. But it wouldn’t for what I wanted. It would not treat a motorcycle store, for instance, as a subdivision of a holding company. I could not pull off separate profit and loss statements or separate balance</p>",
  "page-214": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sheets.”</p><p>Clinton Computers, to its credit, referred Boland to a consultant familiar with the source code of Accounting Plus—a part of the program that would enable it to be customized. The consultant took in Boland’s North Star computer system as a trade-in. He sold him a Delta microcomputer and TeleVideo terminal in return, along with a hard-disk system upgradable to 70 megabytes. With the software customization included, the cost came to $20,000, minus the $12,000 trade-in. The consultant, like Clinton Computers, didn’t know as much about accounting as Boland had hoped. But through sheer tenacity Boland at least got himself a halfway usable program.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I had the software changed,” he said, “so that instead of one company with departments in it, it now reads a holding company with subsidiary companies.</p>",
  "page-215": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">The software was changed to print out separate balance sheets and separate income statements for me.</p><p>“On the income-statement side this machine will ask me if I want a consolidated or individual by-page income statement. It will print out a holding company and then, in successive order, on each page, the income statement for each company. When I go to the balance sheet, it will ask me that same question.</p><p>“If I tell it I want individuals and a consolidated by page, it won’t do it. I must ask it individually each time for company one, then company two, right down the line. I have to give the computer individual instructions to do that.</p><p>“And that was the best my consultant could do to change the software. It got the job done, but not all the way.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I’ve since found out that for $400, not ,800, I could have bought an accounting package that would do</p>",
  "page-216": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">exactly the same thing I wanted.”</p><p>So why didn’t he buy it?</p><p>“Why spend another $400 to delve into it further and then find out <em>it</em> isn’t what you wanted?” Boland asked. “I think it’s stupid to spend money at this point. I have a system I know I can make work within certain limits. I’m still in the learning phase, and I’ll probably still be there for another year, for all I know.” I thought he was too patient. If his software system was a dog—perhaps not for everyone but for him—he should change it. Four hundred dollars was a pittance compared to Boland’s total investment of $20,000.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Ideally, too, as he said himself, he would have gone to a 78consultant in the first place, not just any consultant but one familiar with accounting. And yet it’s understandable why he acted as he did. Why repeat the mistakes he’d seen at other companies? Why not frugality? Better to be out $20,000 than $50,000 or</p>",
  "page-217": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">$100,000 after paying for a mini, a consultant, and the other trimmings.

And yet the two somehow came across as being on opposite sides of the generation gap that all the pundits were babbling about during Vietnam. I could imagine Boland watching M\\A\\S\\H; I could imagine Bowie, in the right setting, being a mild version of Hawkeye. He wouldn’t necessarily do things the traditional way, but in the end no one would care, because whatever it was, he’d succeed. Ed Boland was a man with a fondness for constants—a characteristic that in his profession had served him well. Charlie Bowie, I sensed, enjoyed surprises and change.</p>",

The company’s houses sold for anywhere from $55,000 to $135,000, but most customers were first timers who had never before wended their ways through the mortgage maze. Bowie could reduce his company’s carrying charges if he didn’t rush homes to completion before the customers were ready for them.</p><p>“We don’t make any money until we deliver the house,” he said, “so we need to keep track of the time between when people contract and make application with a lender and how long it takes for them to win loan approval.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“When our company had ninety or a hundred</p>",

Accounting programs can be much trickier than data bases and spreadsheets, especially for companies with unusual circumstances like Boland’s—that is, all those subsidiaries in a small-to-medium business.

Or he might want the program to tote up all the foundation costs or perform other arithmetic, including complicated multiplication and division or calculation of ratios and percentages. And with a program like dBASE II that’s possible. Like many of its rivals, it will do some complex calculations, not just shuffle facts around.

Even without all our records in the computer now, it</p>",
  "page-231": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">saves me and Julie probably five or six hours a week. We were doing it manually before, and we’re on the verge of saving other people in the company lots of time with the loan processing by using dBASE II. I think we’d have to say with five hundred houses in our backlog there is the potential for this to save us $50,000 a year in carrying charges that may have accrued under the old system of keeping loan-processing records.</p><p>“We are going to buy another machine,” Bowie said, “for the Northern Division.”</p><p>The potential $50,000 annual savings from the two machines, by the way, would include just reductions in carrying charges—not in executive time or tasks besides loan processing. Consider 83the economies that would result simply from less paperwork.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“When we first set up the computer,” Bowie said, “we set it up exactly like we were doing things manually.

But the “SALE:PERSN” field, combined with the “SALE:PRICE” one, could tell him which outside sales reps were selling the most expensive homes. In other words, the loan-processing data base was one good way to keep track of the salesmen catering most successfully to the $135,000 buyers.

So Sue suggested the Multiplan spreadsheet program. Multiplan is easy to use, even easier than dBASE II. Julie got started with Multiplan with just fifteen minutes of instruction.”</p><p>Multiplan works on the same idea as the better-known VisiCalc program, which, like WordStar, has sold hundreds and hundreds of thousands of copies.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The true origins of these spreadsheets go back to 1978. A Harvard MBA student disliked the tedium of using a calculator to tote up columns and rows of interrelated numbers; it was boring even with a pocket calculator. A change in just one number could throw</p>",
  "page-234": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">off dozens of other entries, so imagine the brain-numbing effect of making an error and then having to recalculate an entire spreadsheet. Why not write a computer program to alter all the other variables if one changed?</p><p>And so was born the electronic spreadsheet; it and word processing are the single most popular uses of microcomputers—the real justifications for their existence. A VisiCalc-type spreadsheet can add, subtract, multiply, average, do partial sums, find minimums, maximums, simplify your life in a number of ways.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A description of VisiCalc in CPA Micro Report ticks off an awesome number of applications: “sales forecasts, profit and loss 84statements, rate-of-return calculations, project scheduling, tax calculation, pricing strategies, financial planning, loan amortization, league standings and report generation.” An electronic</p>",
  "page-235": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">spreadsheet can help do your checkbook; or it can assist in the preparation of a small country’s budget—which, in fact, has happened.</p><p>Some even say that spreadsheets are contributing to the paperwork deluging American business. VisiCalc coauthor Dan Bricklin disagrees. “A lot of calculations,” he said of the pre-VisiCalc days, “were being done on the backs of envelopes or corners of envelopes or the corners of newspapers. VisiCalc isn’t causing people to produce more numbers and reports. Those numbers were always there, but they weren’t always being identified.”</p><p>“Multiplan is incredible,” Bowie said of his VisiCalc-style software. “I have generated budgets to see if they’ll do all I want them to, to consider all the what ifs.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“And it’s a big help in scheduling production. We have a factory producing cabinets for our homes, and our scheduling system is critical, since at most it can</p>",
  "page-236": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">produce cabinets for only fifteen units a week.” The cabinet plant manager, caught between the demands of Washington Homes’ northern and southern divisions, had scheduled production according to his own whims.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“It was costing us a lot of money in missed settlements,” said Bowie, “and cabinets were not delivered, or they were the wrong color and size.” He was talking in late February, telling how, the other day, he had loaded in thirty-five more cabinet orders and instantly learned “we were out to April 15 on cabinet deliveries. That’s the soonest we could get them based on the plant’s production capabilities. I’m meeting with the manager this morning to see if in the future he can up his output. I’ve found that everybody’s got to live with lead times. Everybody’s got to give us the right lead time on orders, which means we are now ordering cabinets for delivery at the end of April and May, where we generally in the past would not have ordered May</p>",
  "page-237": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">delivery until April. If I miss five house deliveries in a month because of cabinets not being there on time, then that’s ,000 to $5,000 in carrying charges over the next three to five months.”</p><p>Similarly, Multiplan was probably saving Bowie several thousand dollars more over the same period by “identifying houses not started because building permits have not been issued. And it will help identify the reasons why they haven’t been.</p><p>“To get a building permit, all sorts of things must fall into place. And now we can look at any particular job at any particular 85time, and if we see it isn’t started, find out why the permit hasn’t been issued.</p><p>“We can determine if we’re waiting for site plans or a plumbing permit or electrical permit or whatever it happened to be and instantly target and solve that problem.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Before, the record keeping was ‘Go get a permit.</p>",
  "page-238": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Have you got it yet?’ There were no details, no backup. We relied on our field people to get the permits, and they would get the permits in a way that was timely for them and their production schemes but not in a way that was timely for us in bottom-line deliveries. So we are now able to target all the permit process and make it happen at our rate.” Not only was Bowie using Multiplan as a spreadsheet to plug in all the what ifs; he was also using it as a data base, even if it wasn’t as nimble in manipulating nonnumeric data as dBASE II could be.</p><p>Whatever chore Bowie was using Multiplan for, he loved the “Help” screens. He could turn them on to guide himself through the commands he wasn’t familiar with; besides, all of Multiplan’s basic commands were normally at the bottom of the screen, anyway.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Multiplan, by the time you’re reading this, may not be the best spreadsheet on the market, at least not for</p>",
  "page-239": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">you. But at one point CPA Micro Report was pronouncing it the “new Empress of Spreadsheets” for accountants using a wide range of computers. Multiplan even worked with VisiCalc files so that users of the older program could easily convert.</p><p>“Multiplan,” said Micro Report, “... can sort a line-by-line record of events by account number or name—a frequent requirement in CPA applications.” Keepers of expense accounts, presumably, could cherish such a capability. Also, Multiplan, as the newsletter pointed out, lets you name your variables; you could refer more easily to the cells or the exact locations in the columns and rows. Instead of saying cells “A26” or “R38P,” you could refer to “Sales” and “Total Costs.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With programs like Multiplan, software designers are more successfully catering to the needs of businesspeople who want computers to adjust to them rather than the other way around. That’s how it should</p>",
  "page-240": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">be. Bowie is a construction executive, not a computer expert, and Boland’s an accountant rather than a hacker.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Bowie, however, plainly seemed more willing to live with the complexities of existing software. Many in his place would have used a consultant—and wisely, I think, for Washington Homes was a multimillion-dollar operation—yet Bowie had the background and patience to computerize just with guidance from a store. He might not have been a computer expert. But he loved 86the new. He loved complexity if he could logically unravel it. He didn’t mind mistakes. He felt in control because he had backups on disk and on paper. The manuals didn’t scare him. Instead of soaking up every word there, Bowie, like Seymour Rubinstein, had a gift for knowing which page to flip to if he had trouble. Bowie was a born micro user. However serious about his job, he might as well have been a child relaxing after</p>",
  "page-241": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">school with a few rounds of Pac-Man. He loved seeing instant cause-and-effect relationships. He took as much delight in learning where his division could be six months hence as a child might take in winning an arcade game. He considered his computer “the greatest therapy in the world,” an opportunity to “sit down and feel really good” in “a fairly high tension business.”</p><p>Edward Boland, too, however, in a different, more structured way, was curious about numbers and life, and in the end, I suspect, the two men’s learning styles didn’t entirely explain their opinions of their programs. Bolands’ general-ledger software just wasn’t right for his needs. It straitjacketed him. Bowie’s programs, on the other hand, helped him do just about anything he wanted.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Anything,” incidentally, included advancing his career. When I next caught up with him, in May 1984, he was president of another construction firm and</p>",
  "page-242": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">owned one-third of that company and was taking home a paycheck thirty-five percent bigger. Bowie said his computer skills “had a great deal to do with it. I had management tools that not very many other people had.”</p>",

  "page-244": "<p>“I didn’t own one at home at the time.

I had to do them by hand on a calculator. It took hours per client. And I got mad. Most people my age are afraid of computers, but I’d worked with word processors. And what are word processors but another kind of computer?”</p><p>So Scharf left his job as an estate tax planner with a staid old brokerage firm and set up shop at Merrill Lynch’s division dealing with real estate and equipment leasing.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was a VisiCalc devotee’s dream job, one calling for quick, repetitive, accurate math in deals as big as $150</p>",

And that meant more than a little numbers crunching. )</p><p>Imagine the variables. The deals had to be sexy enough to the selling companies for Merrill Lynch to win the bids. At the same time, the tax shelters couldn’t leak. The deals must provide the buyers with the write-offs that the prospectuses from the leasing company promised. Ideally, too, they would yield maximum tax advantages on minimum investments. And for investments of different sizes and at different tax rates, just what would the various benefits be?</p>",
  "page-246": "<p>When Scharf reported for work, he found that the real estate department of the leasing company was on the verge of spending $200,000 a year tapping into an outside firm’s computer to come up with the right numbers. The big machine would have been able to do simple debt-amortization calculations. Scharf could have told a company, for instance, how long it would take to pay off a mortgage on a building for which Merrill Lynch proposed a leaseback. But that was only a small part of what the job needed. And what about the costs?</p><p>So Scharf instead used an Apple system costing less than $7,000, a one-time investment.

  "page-247": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Merrill Lynch Leasing—just didn’t include them. But the Apple could simulate this capability. With the VisiCalc spreadsheet it could juggle around dozens of interrelated statistics, using nightmarishly elaborate algebra with Catch-22-like mathematical spirals. In other words, 88you wanted to know the value of <em>x</em>, and it depended on the value of <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>, and you couldn’t solve for <em>y</em> until you solved <em>z</em>, and you couldn’t solve for <em>z</em> until you knew <em>x</em>.

However faster than without a computer, it still limited your possibilities. You didn’t have as much</p>",
  "page-248": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">time to experiment with all your choices. And the more time Scharf had, the more closely he could consider all the variables and the more attractive could be Merrill Lynch’s leaseback bids.

We worked with Beneficial Corporation. We’ve done a number of K mart stores.”</p><p>Scharf, never smug, still tinkered with the Apple and its software. An observant computer dealer noticed he would keep asking for larger RAM boards to allow him to do bigger, fancier spreadsheets.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And so it was that the dealer nominated Scharf a tester for Lotus 1-2-3 in late summer 1982. 1-2-3 was the new integrated software from Lotus Development Corporation, a Massachusetts firm started by a former rock disk jockey rich with $500,000 in royalties from</p>",

At the time I talked to him, the names and addresses of investors—receiving quarterly income reports—were still stored on an Apple. Scharf was waiting for the right word processor-mailer to come along to work with the 1-2-3. Then the massive retyping job for the address lists would be worthwhile. With space for two thousand names, 1-2-3 would be much more useful than just a small filer. It wouldn’t be just a primitive record-keeping system with limited capacity.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Meanwhile, for Scharf, graphics was a snap. “If I send out a thirty-page bid, I do three or four graphs with it,” Scharf said. “We have a selling job to do with both the potential corporate leasees and the potential inventors. The presentations are complex, and the</p>",
  "page-254": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">graphics come in very handy. We use line graphs and bar graphs showing the expense of lease payments versus mortgage payments if they went out and mortgaged the properties conventionally. The minimum terms of the leases are usually twenty-five years; it’s a huge numbers-crunching job, and we try to simplify everything as much as we can. I come up with the figures on the spreadsheet part of 1-2-3. Then I tell what I want on the graph. Maybe I want to make a line for the rental income, interest expense, depreciation, or taxable income. So I select the appropriate columns on the spreadsheet. Then I push ‘V’ for ‘View,’ and I can see my work instantly as a graph. If I don’t like it, I can quickly redo my calculations and look at the graph again.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“And 1-2-3 offers a tremendous range of printing options. You can specify how many rows you want per page. You can tell if you want border lines separating</p>",

Soft.letter, Jeffrey Tarter’s trade publication, noted that all integrated programs compromised in some way and were the software version of a Swiss army knife. “Swiss army knives are nifty gadgets; we’ve got several ourselves,” said Soft.letter, “but we don’t use them much. Instead, we use specialized tools for specialized tasks—screw-drivers for poking around inside the</p>",

Each of these tools does its specific job better than the multipurpose tool.”</p><p>At least in the version available as of this writing—listing for $495—Lotus 1-2-3 didn’t have a real word processor. You could write paragraphs. But it lacked the speed of true word processors and was awkward. Nor did it offer communications software to use with a modem. Context MBA, a rival integrated program, did. But then MBA’s spreadsheet module wasn’t nearly as fierce a numbers cruncher as 1-2-3’s was.</p><p>Lotus planned to improve 1-2-3’s text-processing ability—which it did, ultimately, along with the data base, graphics, and spreadsheet capabilities of a super-1-2-3 called Symphony. The new program, unlike 1-2-3, also let you talk to other computers.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At Merrill Lynch Leasing, however, Scharf hadn’t</p>",

They had cost $40,000, including extras like printers; except for service, that was it.

He and I are baffled. We can’t understand the Mac’s lack of cursor keys. Why couldn’t Apple have kindly let Mac users move the cursor conventionally on the screen if they wanted? Omitting the cursor keys was IBM-style arrogance, no ifs or buts.

Stewart’s firm didn’t rush blindly into computerization. Originally, it had been hand culling articles from 140 periodicals and 16 major daily newspapers. “We sat down,” Hillard recalled, “and worked out a mathematical formula to give weight to a particular article by mention of certain</p>",
  "page-284": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">words, certain individuals, certain companies.” Existing data bases like The Source and Dialog just wouldn’t do. You couldn’t easily use them to search out the political patterns affecting the fortunes of Stewart’s clients.</p><p>Stewart spent $31,000 on a computer and soon was suffering defective circuits and junky software. He paid a secretary to cram almost a million words of newspaper articles into the machine’s hard-disk memory, but it still couldn’t fetch facts as easily as he’d hoped. Then the data-base program, the one he was using to store facts and juggle them around, crashed—apparently overwhelmed by the volume of data. Micro data bases at the time, the early 1980s, couldn’t easily handle big hunks of text. Stewart couldn’t retrieve whole articles.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was time for a consultant. A good consultant (the “Who” theoretically could write or install a new program (the “What” in an effective way (the “How”), justify his actions (the “Why”), and ideally do</p>",
  "page-285": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">everything at a reasonable price (the “How much” before the data base grew too unwieldy(the “When”). Stewart wanted him working on his own premises (the “Where”) as much as possible so he could supervise him.) ) )</p><p>“Our first consultant lasted all of four days,” Stewart said. “He was abrasive, nasty, and didn’t know what he was doing. One of our staffers was so frustrated trying to work with him that she 102wept. We’d hired him because he was a friend of a friend and said, ‘I’m a computer programmer. I can fix it for you.’ We never quite could pin him down about his background. We were so burned that for five or six months we put off hiring another consultant.</p><p>“And when we did get one,” said Stewart, “we wanted a solid, established firm.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So he went to a government contractor headquartered in an imposing building, the size of a</p>",
  "page-286": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">small public library. The consultants even owned the same-model computer that Stewart’s company did.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, they were using different software for much different purposes. Stewart’s needs were new to them.</p><p>“Look at MDBS,” Hillard recalls telling the contractor. “It really looks like a good package.”</p><p>But he says the consultants told him they hadn’t even heard of it.</p><p>That in itself might have been a tipoff that Stewart had hired the wrong people for the job. MDBS stood for Micro Data Base Systems. Ads and reviews about it had appeared in Byte and other prominent publications of the micro world.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With the clock ticking away at up to $35 an hour, the consultants searched for data-base software meeting Stewart’s detailed specifications. “Three weeks later,” Hillard said, “they handed me a bill for $2,500 and said,</p>",
  "page-287": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">‘The package you need to use is MDBS.’ I said, ‘Where is the work, where are the hours in relationship to the $2,500 bill?’ It went around in circles.” Stewart and Hillard must have remembered the old saying that a consultant borrows your watch to tell you the time of day and then charges you for it.</p><p>According to Stewart, in fact, the consultants based most of the report on material his company had given them.</p><p>By think-tank standards in his area, Stewart may have gotten a bargain. Dealing with consultants new to micro data bases, however, he was in effect paying their tuition.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“The federal government must like them immensely,” Stewart said, “because they do good, documented work in the fields they have expertise in. But a small businessman had no business using them. After two and one-half months we had nothing but</p>",
  "page-288": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">recommendations on the data base—and a stack of bills”—$2,500 high.</p><p>But there was hope. Stewart’s corporate benefactors were sticking with him. If he could get his data base running, he could easily recoup his losses, offering clients a treasure trove of information about government policy-making affecting them. Although Stewart 103thought of himself as a truth seeker, his vice-president was bluntly a money man. “We would have sold our service for a million a year,” Hillard said, “and we would have netted $600,000. We were using four people to feed the articles into the computer, but that would have changed, because optical readers eventually could scan magazine articles and newsprint.”</p><p>So now Hillard shopped around for a new savior to unravel the complexities of the MDBS software that he had settled on.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He found three possibilities. One consultant, a</p>",
  "page-289": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">micro expert, was snowed under with work, and another man had only mainframe experience. So Hillard and Stewart chose Fred Brown, a retired military officer who had worked not only on big computers but also little Radio Shacks and TeleVideos. In fact, Brown came recommended by the manager of a local computer store. The manager leveled with Stewart. He said he and Brown were together in a partnership developing software for lawyers’ offices. Hillard asked only two people about Brown. And both references came from the computer-store manager with the business relationship with the consultant. Inquiring about Brown, however, Hillard asked some good questions. Did Brown document the software properly? Did he, in other words, tell how to use or change it? Did his software work? Did he meet deadlines? Did he live up to all the specifications in his contracts? “I got affirmative answers to most of these</p>",
  "page-290": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">questions,” Hillard said. One reference said a software project of Brown’s hadn’t come in on time but brushed off the problem as a hardware one.</p><p>Unfortunately, Hillard didn’t ask <em>all</em> the right questions. Brown had never before worked with the brand of computer that Stewart Research was using; nor was he fully comfortable at the time with the exact kind of software used at the company.</p><p>Brown, however, struck Hillard as “a very nice professional.” He wore three-piece suits, lived in a $140,000 home with several computers in the basement, and held a masters degree from an Ivy League school.</p><p>“No problem,” Brown told Hillard. “Listen, I charge——” He gave an hourly figure to the nearest cent; $30.02, we’ll say.</p><p>“What?” asked Hillard. “Why 0.<em>02</em> an hour?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I like to be fair about my salary, and that gives me</p>",
  "page-291": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">$30,000 a year.”</p><p>“Okay,” said Hillard, “that’s cute.”</p><p>Brown wasn’t about to apply for welfare. On top of the $30,000 for consulting part of the time, he was enjoying income from sales of computer hardware. In short, he came across as successful and honest. And he may have been. Just the same, client and consultant were clearly mismatched.</p><p>Their downfall was a familiar kind—software problems.</p><p>You could customize the MDBS program in FORTRAN or BASIC. The earlier consultants, the ones with the large government contractor, had suggested FORTRAN. Brown himself was more familiar with that than with BASIC. And Stewart was convinced that FORTRAN would make the best use of software already purchased. So Brown went ahead with it despite three strikes against him:</p></ul>",
  "page-292": "<ul><li>The computer company’s FORTRAN, according to Stewart, was as badly botched as its hardware.</li><li>FORTRAN wasn’t as good as BASIC for micro data bases that stashed away English prose rather than mainly numbers. Another consultant was amazed when I told him that Brown had used FORTRAN in a data base storing newspaper stories. “You can use it if you like,” he said, “but you’ll lose something. It’s like trying to translate Hemingway into pidgin English.”</li><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">Brown was still basically a mainframer. And micro FORTRAN was different from the kind used at large military installations. Writing software for micros is like writing short stories instead of novels. You’ve got to be more elegant and get to the point faster. A micro’s memory simply lacks the capacity of a mainframe and brooks less sloppiness than would a larger machine. Many great novelists could</li></ul>",
  "page-293": "<ul><li class=\"split-li \">never write decent short stories, and many first-class mainframers just couldn’t code cleverly or deviously enough for micros—couldn’t electronically trick them into thinking they were larger machines.</li></ul><p>“What happened,” said Hillard, “is that we were paying for Brown’s training on how to use FORTRAN on a micro. He spent forty or fifty hours developing specifications for the data base and writing the code. This went on and on. Brown kept running into all these problems, and he could have cleared up some with just a quick call to the manufacturer.” Meanwhile, the money clock was ticking.</p><p>Several months later, thousands of dollars richer from those $30.02-hours, Brown threw up his hands. “This isn’t going to work in FORTRAN at all,” he said. “Maybe we should do this in BASIC.”</p><p>“So,” Hillard told me, “all the work he’d done up to that point was out the window.”</p>",
  "page-294": "<p>“And on top of that,” Stewart said, “we were anticipating our new software package and didn’t care to feed the information twice into the computer. So we built up a backlog of well over 10,000 articles waiting for the software that never came.”</p><p>Brown’s clock ticked away for several thousand dollars more in time, bringing the total billing to $8,630.81. Then it stopped. Stewart Research had simply run out of money.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Stewart’s corporate sponsor could send no more. “Their pockets,” he said, “just weren’t deep enough to subsidize both our own computer literacy and that of our consultants.” When I talked to Stewart in mid-1983, his computer was doing word processing and other minor chores. “But,” he said, “it does hardly enough cross-referencing to be a major data bank.” His research firm faced some $30,000 in debts, including much of the $2,500 bill from the consultants with the</p>",
  "page-295": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">library-sized building; and he and his wife were the only two employees left in Stewart R & D. He still hoped to get the data base going, however. “We’re going to become computer consultants in self-defense,” said Stewart. “I’ve done nothing but work on this computer for a year.” It would be nice to be able to do the same, but most of us lack the time or talent; the challenge is to find the right computer consultant so you won’t end up feeling you must do the work on your own.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Not so coincidentally, Hillard himself actually did go on to become a computer consultant part time. He wasn’t the smartest or the best credentialed, but he had what many of the more established consultants lacked—empathy and humility. Don’t shrug off those traits. The real question, as one consultant pointed out to me, isn’t just whether someone is competent; it’s whether he’s competent enough at the job he’s doing for you. Never forget that when pondering the “Who?” and</p>",
  "page-296": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">“What?”</p><p>Stewart and Hillard obviously aren’t the only people who didn’t ask the right questions in time. A sail maker wasted $18,000 on a computer system recommended by a consultant. The machine didn’t work right with the hard-disk memory, and it lacked proper shielding against the 60-cycle hum given off by power lines. By the time Hillard was on the scene, the consultant had left town. He says the computer was such a disaster that “I suggested to the client that he get a length of rope and use it as an anchor because it was unfixable.” In another case, a truck-rental firm spent $30,000 for $15,000 of computer equipment. And then the consultant didn’t even supply instructions to operate and modify the software. “As far as I know,” said a more ethical expert, “he’s still a consultant. Computers are mystical, and most people don’t know when they’ve got a good system or when they’ve got a bad one.”</p>",
  "page-297": "<p>“The real problem,” Hillard correctly said of consultants, “is that the microcomputer field has only been around since the mid-seventies and things are moving so rapidly. It’s hard for anyone to keep up, consultant or layman.”</p><p>There is, too, a nasty economic fact. A micro consultant can’t 106reach full prosperity, in many instances, without having ties with stores or manufacturers. Indeed, most micro consulting nowadays is done in effect by sales reps recommending systems to their customers. How objective can they be? Even conscientious consultants—independent or those with ties—may still favor the computers and software with which they’re most familiar. The man and the machine in effect become one package.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Another anticonsultant argument is that small computers may soon be inexpensive and simple enough to make consultants much less necessary. You don’t use</p>",
  "page-298": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a consultant to buy a $1,000 typewriter. And by the time you read this, or a few years afterward, we’ll have good, complete word processors selling for no more—with printers.</p><p>Yet another anticonsultant argument is that you may have computer-wise friends in your own business or profession, smart people you trust. They may actually anticipate some of your needs better than would a consultant. Moreover, it’s been said that if you know enough to pick the right consultant, then you really don’t need one.</p><p>I’m not sure. As one consultant pointed out, it’s like choosing doctors. You can be good at choosing one without necessarily knowing brain surgery.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I was a borderline case. I still might have bought a Kaypro without Michael Canyes’s approval, since I knew another writer familiar with the glories of the Osborne who appreciated the greater glories of the</p>",
  "page-299": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Kaypro. On the other hand, with my consultant friend’s guidance, I could shop for the lowest price rather than the most technical help from the dealer. And Michael steered me away from the dot-matrix printer, which, with their inferior print quality at the time, would have been bad news for me. I was lucky. I had befriended Michael through an Osborne user group at a time when he himself was looking for advice on writing, so he didn’t even charge me. You may be similarly lucky if you have a skill a computer consultant needs. But don’t count on it. So often, free consultants are worth their charges.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Had I not been as fortunate and had I experienced difficulties, I would have been willing to pay for advice. And mind you, my whole system costs less than $3,000. “You don’t want to spend $10,000 on a computer system,” Michael warns, “and find it doesn’t do what you want. You’d be better off spending several hundred</p>",
  "page-300": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">dollars or more to learn exactly what you want and get some help installing it. Think of the business you’ll lose if you install your computer and it doesn’t work as planned. It depends. You could also spend a lot of time shopping and talking to people and not pay a consultant. It depends what your time is worth. The 107average guy has one or two uses for his computer in mind, and he doesn’t want to piddle around with the complexities of the thing. He just wants to cut right down to the core of it and get this job moving. If a consultant spends two or three hours with someone discussing a micro, it may cost perhaps $75 or $100. But the client might master in a day what might normally take a week or even several.” The wrong consultant, however, may actually cost you more—in money and time.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When shopping around for the right one, you’ll first want to consider a _what_—what work you need him</p>",
  "page-301": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">for. Forget about computers. Does the task make sense commercially? Are you realistic about its costs? A former New England consultant tells of a baseball enthusiast who wanted to recreate some board games on the computer screen. It might have worked. But the man didn’t just want a computerized arcade game here—rather, a replication of ball parks, with their actual proportions. “He had a statistical background,” recalled the ex-consultant, “and had done some statistical consulting for a professional sports organization.” But there was a problem. The man believed that the consultant could perform this miracle on an Apple for less than $5,000. Actually, the program would have cost $50,000 to write—probably more than the man could quickly recoup through sales of the program. The consultant turned down this mission impossible. But the client let his enthusiasm for the project blot out his business sense and in fact squandered $55,000 on</p>",

Do as with software; get as clear an idea as you can of the paperwork you’re computerizing. You may want your electronic files organized entirely differently from your paper ones. Whatever the case, plan ahead. You don’t want to—as somebody once put it—automate your confusion. And there’s another reason for knowing your precise needs before calling a consultant. Trying to jack up the bill, some experts can be brilliant at inventing new problems to fit their prepackaged solutions. Or they may downplay your real needs because the answers are not in their tool kits.</p><p>You’ll also want to decide if the consultant is just to give advice or more. Don’t pay simply for advice, then expect him to haggle with equipment suppliers and install the software.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And what about other services besides advice? Take</p>",

United, a $14 billion conglomerate, produces everything from helicopters to air conditioners and silicon chips. “We’re a high-tech company,” Bennett said. “More and more of our products have microprocessors in them.” Most of the senior executives, however, had never used a personal computer before Bennett started a training program for those baffled by tech talk. “It’s not a productivity program,” Bennett said. “It’s an educational program.” With the $5 million program’s stress on hands-on experience, however, those goals meshed nicely.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">United homed in on the computer skills that</p>",

In 1983 and 1984, more than a thousand United executives were to learn to use the IBM PC and the Context MBA program. Bennett had settled on the IBM one Christmas vacation when he himself tested several different brands. It was his own initiation to personal computing. He surmised that plenty of software would be coming for the IBM, and in fact Context MBA did appear in time with tools he wanted for United’s executives; the integrated 121program</p>",

Blowups of IBM computer equipment lined a wall. It was as though United were doing all it could to engender concentration. If an executive turned to gaze at a nonexistent window, the sight of the photographs might gently nudge him back to work. Up front was a projection screen and an easel bearing such “EXTRA ACTIVITY” suggestions as “EXPERIMENT WITH VARIOUS COMMANDS ON YOUR SPREADSHEET.” In a photo from United’s public relations office, the carpeted room looked like a cross between a college classroom and a ComputerLand store.

With sixteen IBM computers and matching printers, the training project couldn’t travel very far.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One of the students was himself a local of sorts, Robert J. Bertini, Jr., controller of the East Hartford research center. He was an MBA in his mid-forties, and in some ways he typified many of the executives in the program. “To a certain extent,” he said of his thoughts before he took the course, “you’re afraid you’re going to screw up.” He had toyed with the idea of buying an Apple or Commodore but “didn’t want to sit there and read a book and hunt and peck at the keyboard.” Still, he was constructively egotistical: if others could master computers, why not he? So he signed up. On paper the program was completely voluntary. In practice, perhaps, what with peer pressure, it was army voluntary. “We just didn’t feel the management of a high-technology company could be competitive without knowing what the computer can do for them,” Bennett had said in</p>",
  "page-343": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">announcing the program, and who wants to be known as noncompetitive? Still, the company was bending over backward to make the training as palatable as it could. Within minutes of the computer instructor’s first “Good morning,” Bertini was learning how to load disks into the little IBM machine and type out the commands of Context MBA. Mercifully, he wasn’t wrestling with unneeded computerese. “Most manuals,” Bennett correctly says, “are not written with executives in mind. Most are written for people who know how to use computers. On page thirty-something of the manual it eventually gets around to telling people how to start their computers up.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Just a week after Bertini finished the course, his own IBM PC arrived at his office. Man and machine were still new to each other, and data-processing people were ready to help overcome the normal start-up glitches, but Bertini faced other problems. 122Would he have</p>",
  "page-344": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">time during the normal work day to perfect his computer skills? Nearly thirty people reported to him, and now the machine, too, would be vying for his attention. He also worried some about his image as he groped around on the computer. “Hell,” he candidly said, “we all have our degrees of vanity.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Once again, however, United had a solution, a routine one in the training program. It allowed Bertini to take the IBM home. “Let’s face it,” he said, “the course taught you the basics, how to get on the machine, how to do some relatively simple, basic things with it. To learn other stuff that makes it the tool it really is took eighty or ninety hours or whatever I spent with the thing at home.” Even after Bertini mastered the IBM, he still used it at home for chores like checkbook balancing—and for work, too; especially work. “My wife,” he joked, “decided that the reason this thing was going to be a big productivity improvement</p>",
  "page-345": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">for the corporation was that I’d put in that extra eight hours at home and give them a sixteen-hour day.” He also found himself working later some days at the office.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But Bertini emerged a believer in both the training program and the machine. As chief fiscal officer at the 1,200-employee research center, he helped preside over much of United’s research and development budget—then $800 million a year. His life was a series of what ifs. What about that $4-million mainframe computer; should United buy or lease it? What about taxes, depreciation, interest rates? What about a number of what abouts? Traditionally, Bertini had waited around for answers from his staffers, which could take hours or days; but now he had his own computer and electronic spreadsheet and could consider more options faster. The IBM was also handy for confidential tasks like salary analyses. “As far as merit increases for my people</p>",
  "page-346": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">were concerned,” said Bertini, “I had access to it, and they didn’t. And that’s the way I wanted it to be.” He also wrote letters and memos on the computer. “Would you believe, twenty years ago in college I took a typing course?” he said. When Bertini wrote to Harry Gray—United’s chairman—the center controller’s secretary redid the letters on a typewriter. But the little dot-matrix printer worked well for memos zipped out to Bertini’s staffers. The communications part of Context MBA was also a joy, for Bertini could send electronic mail and tap United’s mainframe for facts that previously had been filtered through subordinates. Some staffers resented his new ability to bypass them. It was a reversal of normal roles. The boss had a personal computer before they did and was now better plugged in to United’s information network. “As far as I’m concerned,” Bertini said, defending his new system, “the boss’s job is to second-guess you.” But the worried</p>",

Even a simple request like that was too much.”</p><p>At least the chair was adjustable “I lowered it so I could get my eyes as close to the middle of the screen as possible,” she says. “I was so low that if I opened the middle drawer on my desk I’d bang myself.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But it was the lights that most irked Joan.

One was by job function; lending officers were there as well as those overseeing the existing projects. People also came from different parts of the office’s bureaucracy, from different countries, and, obviously, from different job levels—everyone from secretaries to division chiefs.

And quality is more of a problem, too, because, as Barry notes, “someone in centralized word processing won’t normally get hell for not catching an error. I expect my secretary to challenge anything she’s not certain about. For instance, my secretary will come in and say, ‘You left such-and-such person off the list of people receiving the memo.’ Which matters. Often who a memo goes to matters as much as what’s in the memo.”</p><p>And what about the question of knowing which calls to put through to the boss? Around the time Barry and I talked, he was obsessed with a paper projecting the World Bank’s office needs for the next twenty-five years. He didn’t have to tell his secretary of the importance of any call about the paper. She knew. For she’d been helping him put it together.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“It isn’t a question anymore of the efficient use of</p>",

The terminal, however, had other shortcomings—for instance, the lack of simple knobs to adjust the screen’s brightness and contrast. Waters instead had to control them with a series of keystrokes that he was always forgetting. His loudest groans, though, were over the numbers pad to the right of the keyboard. “I count 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9,” Waters said. “I don’t want anything where I count 7-8-9-4-5-6-1-2-3.” That’s how his numbers pad was; that’s how my</p>",

Actually, you simply may need a better screen.

And what about x-rays?</p><p>A computer user sits much closer to the screen than most TV-watchers do; might this increase the danger? After all, a typical computer, like a TV, uses a cathode ray tube with a high-voltage charge. An electron gun fires these subatomic particles toward the phosphor coating on your screen.

Until researchers can absolve computers of blame in cases like Laura Moore’s, the VDT safety issue will remain legitimate.</p><p>“The wild cards in the VDT debate are the eleven clusters of problem pregnancies and miscarriages among women who work on or nearby VDTs,” says Louis Slesin, editor of Microwave News and publisher of the sister publication VDT News.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">These clusters—found in widely scattered offices in the U.S. and Canada—may result from causes other</p>",
  "page-441": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">than radiation. Some VDT operators feel less in control of their jobs than do traditional typists; and a remote possibility exists that this additional stress could take its toll on the unborn children. Slesin says fear of VDTs may itself increase the stress—a Catch-22 if ever one existed.</p><p>Seeking a definitive answer on the birth-defect and miscarriage questions, NIOSH in 1984 was planning a study of about 5,000 pregnancies in a two-year period. Perhaps one-half of the women would use terminals. And the study would tell if they had more miscarriages and children with birth defects than did the other mothers. It would not pinpoint the cause, however—justification for further study.</p><p>A possible culprit here is very low frequency (VLF radiation from the flyback transformer. )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The transformer whips the cathode ray tube’s electron beams from one side to the other of the</p>",
  "page-442": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">phosphor-coated screen, then back again.

Could pulses at this frequency have biological effects?</p><p>We don’t know about VLF. But a Spanish scientist named Jose Delgado says even very weak pulses of extremely low-frequency radiation (ELF), the term for below 300 cycles a second, have damaged chick embryos. Some authorities question the “Delgado effect”; still, scientists in both the U.S. and Europe are undertaking similar experiments. Trying to gauge the possible risks from ELF, researchers may face certain technical complexities. Some scientists talk about “windows” of power and frequency. Just a slightly lower or higher frequency, for instance, might mean the difference between safety and danger for expectant mothers.</p>",
  "page-443": "<p>Like it or not, the jury is still out on the low frequency issue, and some companies may want to protect themselves legally—just in case—by transferring pregnant women from VDTs. Ideally you’d coordinate this policy with those regarding maternity leaves and other health benefits; then a woman would feel free to tell you immediately about her pregnancy instead of disguising it for as long as possible.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Even if radio frequency radiation is a culprit, there is some hope. Slesin notes that the flyback transformer is on the side or back of a computer monitor rather than in the front near the operator. That isn’t the best news for someone sitting near the flyback transformer of a coworker’s machine, but perhaps the VLF threat isn’t so great to someone without any other VDTs nearby. “With the right office layout,” says Mark Pinsky, editor of VDT News, 156“you might be able to greatly reduce exposure to VLFs fields. And obviously the risk to</p>",

Don’t lie to your people that there’s nothing to worry about; do point out that the risks are low enough to justify computerization’s benefits.</p><p>“Can computer screens cause cataracts?” some employees might also ask.</p><p>Probably not. A NIOSH study at the Baltimore Sun found no greater number of cataracts among VDT users than nonusers (although the researchers noted that the employees on VDTs averaged less than four years at the tube—perhaps not long enough to suffer the cataracts).</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">To be sure, strong microwave radiation indeed can</p>",
  "page-445": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">lead to cataracts. But VDTs don’t give off microwaves, and no one has suggested that ELF and VLF are responsible for cataracts. Maybe there are other causes.

Bunnell, then publisher and editor in chief. “She even provides her own coffee.” An office for her might have cost the equivalent of $1,200 a year. More important, however, Bunnell happily noted the thousands of words she writes for each issue: “She couldn’t be more productive, and she does her research conscientiously.

Imagine a professional building with a real estate agency next to a stockbroker, a doctor across the hall from a commodities trader. Well, that’s how it would be in a building housing neighborhood centers, except a sign outside a suite might say “General Motors” rather than “Dr. Pearlman.” Of course a company might instead have fewer centers and lease whole floors.

Why not use computerized lists to bring together people in the first place? “Neighborhood work centers could themselves become employers, selling clerical or professional services to other organizations,” said one of the consultants working with Harkness 217on a landmark telecommuting study for the Stanford Research Institute in the late 1970s.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Munytels, in addition, could be drop-off points for</p>",

Corporations, encouraged by tax breaks or government subsidies, might together establish munytels in poorer neighborhoods.</p><p>Munytels would be <em>one</em> response to some thoughtful criticisms of telecommuting made by Janice C. Blood, 9 to 5’s information director.</p><p>“If you’re a secretary earning $11,000 a year,” she says, “will your employer build you an addition for your computer room?

  "page-627": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">typewriter?”</p><p>More likely, however, clerical workers instead would receive <em>some</em> more money for turning out a lot more work. Whatever the case, munytels could be a solution to the equipment issue—in 218addition to the obvious one of company-supplied computers in various cases.</p><p>But workers should still be free to use their own terminals. Remember Hollis Vail’s preference for <em>his</em> printer?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He’s right.

A few senior managers could electronically monitor the masses toiling at home—could count and time their keystrokes.</p><p>But between the top people and the ones entering the data, companies would need many fewer run-of-the-mill supervisors.</p><p>And that would pinch off some promotion opportunities for the clerical workers.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In some ways, however, companies might make nonsupervisory work more palatable.

Ideally, however, this won’t deprive society of telecommuting’s benefits. Munytels, after all, could help solve the child-care problem, and changes in the labor laws could guarantee the fairness of the piecework system for all. Existing ones do cover clerks doing piecework. They must, for instance, keep time records to show they’re collecting the equivalent of the minimum wage.</p><p>In a related matter, a controversy was swirling in 1984 around a 42-year-old federal ban on commercial home knitting—an issue of interest to companies considering telecommuting.

With widespread telecommuting, oil price increases would no longer be so scary if another energy crisis threatened the United States.</p><p>Jack Nilles once calculated that the typical computer terminal uses less than 125 watts, and a phone line takes up no more than a watt. Then he matched those figures against a private automobile’s typical energy use during commutes, and he found that telecommuting would have a twenty-nine-to-one energy advantage. Compared to mass transit systems loaded to capacity—a rarity in most American cities—it would still enjoy two-to-one 220superiority. With ten million telecommuters, the country might save three-quarters of a billion gallons of gasoline a year.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“At least in the United States,” notes Richard Harkness, “commuting accounts for 35 percent of all auto and truck fuel consumption.” Much, maybe even</p>",

Eighty-four percent of those commutes are by automobile, 65 percent with only the driver. Two hundred and twenty million Americans consume 18 million barrels of oil per day, roughly 30 percent of the world’s supply.” He also notes the cost of America maintaining forty thousand miles of superhighways and 4 million miles of streets and roads. “It has been estimated,” says Harkness, “that 248,500 U.S. bridges need major repairs at a cost of $47 billion.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And beyond the energy and financial prices, what about the psychological ones?

And some people’s $2 MCI letters, passed on to the U.S. Postal Service for delivery as “hard copy,” were taking several days to arrive. Still other MCI messages, hard copy or electronic, never reached their destinations at any time. Service to New York seemed the worst but was better to medium-sized cities, especially in the Midwest.

A “mailbox” is just $18 a year, and if you can dial up MCI locally as people in most large cities can, you pay a mere $1 to send 1,000 words computer-to-computer in the U.S.—including 233Hawaii.

  "page-707": "<h3>A Bus</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">A cable hooks up a bus network’s computers in parallel in the manner of lights on some Christmas trees.</p><p>A bus network may offer advantages in office layouts. You don’t have to clutter things up with a whole series of wires running back to fancy equipment in a central location.

  "page-708": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">about it other than the software and the wire.</p><p>Fancier systems using a bus—like most versions of Ethernet and Corvus Systems’ popular micro network called Omninet—need a file server.</p><p>A file server can be a computer minus the keyboard and screen but with extra communications ports to help signals get in and out in a hurry. It’s connected to the hard disk, which stores and relays the electronic files that people send it. In some networks a file server can also be a regular computer simply assigned to the job.</p><p>With a server arrangement you’re always sharing files with the server rather than directly with other members of the network. The hard disk is between you and the machine you’re trying to reach.</p><p>By the way, <em>if</em> everyone must use software from the server, that means a very, very busy hard disk—and potentially slower running programs.</p>",
  "page-709": "<h3>A Star</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">In star topology, the individual computers are at the points of a starlike layout of cables radiating from a file server.</p><p>If the server conks out, everyone in the network is out of luck.

If the ring’s broken, the network crashes.</p><p>Also, distance may be limited to less than a few hundred feet without costly repeaters. With the right equipment and enough money, however, you can go much farther.</p><p>One beauty of a ring arrangement is that in small networks the speeds can be very fast.

You “hold” the ball until the message you’ve sent comes back to you through the 246ring. Then you send the ball on its way to the next computer. The whole process, of course, is almost instantaneous.</p><p>Some people say it may be easier to design software for a ring, since the token passing means there’s no chance of signals colliding.</p><p>Radio Shack’s Arcnet uses token passing.</p><p>You also may end up grappling with different wiring styles.</p>",
  "page-713": "<h3>Telephone Style</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">WEB-style networks mostly use a cable somewhat like the kind between the outside of your house and your phone jack. This cable has four conductors—individual wires within it. Commonly, two “hot” conductors carry computer signals. Between them, often, are two ground wires attached to the computers. You need good, solid ground connections for the networks to work right.</p>",
  "page-714": "<h3>Twisted Pair</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">A twisted-pair network is what it sounds like—one normally using a pair of wires that twist around each other to form a long spiral.

So now I’d show that my little Kaypro, with a free software program and a $150 modem, could talk almost instantly to a stranger’s computer on the other side of the planet for perhaps a fraction of the cost of a telex. It seemed fitting. Clarke, after all, had written <em>2010</em> with WordStar and decades ago had practically invented the idea of communications satellites.</p><p>And if I failed to catch up with Clarke by computer? Well, I supposed it would be like a train journey to Outer Mongolia; I at least could write of the experience of <em>trying</em> to get there and of the people I met along the way.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I’d cop out in one more respect. Rather than ask Clarke the usual reporterish questions, I would turn the job over to others. The first was Eric Meyer, twelve years old, who was learning assembly language, a feat at any age, and who planned to start a software company</p>",
  "page-725": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">called New Technologies.</p><p>Eric himself had just passed his novice examination for an amateur license, and over the phone, with a push button, I tapped out my idea in international Morse code.</p><p>“How,” I inquired, “would you like to ask Arthur Clarke some questions?”</p><p>“Who’s Arthur Clarke?” Eric replied by voice.</p><p>It was a pardonable response. Clarke’s 2001—the book and movie for which he’s most famous—had come out several years before Eric’s birth. And yet as much as anything, Eric’s reply showed where we were headed in this age of specialization. He might someday be programming the future equivalents of HAL, developing new forms of artificial intelligence, and yet he apparently had not heard of HAL’s creator.</p><p>I told Eric who Clarke was. “No, thanks,” Eric tapped.</p>",
  "page-726": "<p>“But he’s the most famous science-fiction writer in the world,” I said, and explained the kind of issues that he might ask about.</p><p>Eric, however, still wasn’t completely impressed. “Does he understand technical things?”</p><p>I assured Eric that Arthur Clarke was technical enough to be worth his time. “We’re going to do this by computers over the phone lines,” I said. “In fact, I’d like you to send your questions to me by computer. Then I’ll store them inside mine. And then I’ll shoot them by computer to Arthur Clarke there in Sri Lanka. You’ll be communicating machine to machine, sort of.”</p><p>“Where’s Sri Lanka?”</p><p>“It’s an island in the Indian Ocean.”</p><p>“Would you use my communications program?” Eric asked.</p><p>Eric wasn’t talking about software he’d bought. It was what he had <em>written</em>.</p>",
  "page-727": "<p>“No,” I said. “I’m going to use MODEM7, because I’m familiar with it.”</p><p>“Couldn’t you say you used a communications program written by Eric Meyer, age twelve?” he asked. It wasn’t the worst twist in the world—good for the book, good for Eric, who, as a reporter’s son, showed a precocious public relations sense. “I won’t use it to reach Clarke,” I said, “but you can use it to send your file to me.”</p><p>“All right.”</p><p>“Read 2001,” I said.</p><p>Eric readily agreed.</p><p>“I remember the title,” he said later, “but I was out when one of the kids in my class gave a report on it.”</p><p>“I’ll want your reaction.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">We also attended to another matter. Eric didn’t own an amateur radio rig yet, and I offered to lend him my</p>",
  "page-728": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Heathkit, a little five-watt transmitter-receiver stashed away in the closet of my efficiency apartment.</p><p>“Is it digital?” Eric asked. Did it have, in other words, a “non-dial” like those newfangled watches?</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“I was hoping it was.”</p><p>“It’s transistorized.” That was good enough for me. Who needed a radio without a dial?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Eric took me up on my offer, which included the gift of some old chassis and capacitors and other parts, forgotten until now in the crawl space of my parents’ home. And I was pleased that Eric accepted, for I liked the symmetry of it all. Two decades earlier Lynn Wilson had given me some of the very equipment I’d be passing on to Eric. And so I visited my parents’ basement that weekend and reentered the past, not only my own but also that of electronics, including computers in a sense; for perhaps this is how the micro age had <em>truly</em></p>",
  "page-729": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">begun—hobbyists swapping parts back and forth until someone accumulated enough to build a system that actually worked.</p><p>Lynn Wilson was all over the crawl space. I picked up a 6146 transmitter tube on which he had playfully magic markered, “For David, K4DIG, DX King.” DX was the amateur radio jargon for long-distance communications.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I lingered in that basement, thinking that somehow, examining the past, I might better understand the future. There were no new clues, however, nothing but bulky transformers and spaghettilike wires and resistors and capacitors and the other odds and ends of my youth. But what a record my junk pile was of the American electronics industry. Half gutted, near the 6146, reposed a silvery ARC-5, a war-surplus receiver. Had it flown? ARC-5s were what American bombers carried during the Second World War. Had a B-17 crew</p>",
  "page-730": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">kept in touch with England with my ARC-5 while 252pummeling the Third Reich? Had my receiver seen action over Tokyo? Scrapping it, had I inadvertently defiled History? Near the ARC-5 I saw a giant condenser for a transmitter. With row after row of plates on a metal shaft, it looked like an electronic potato slicer. I thought of fingernail-sized chips in computers today; the big potato slicer might as well be an artifact from another species. There in the crawl space the 1950s showed up in little vacuum tubes the size of pill bottles. They were a reminder of the short-sightedness of the U.S. electronics executives who had stayed years too long with vacuum-tube technology. Just what did this mean to American computer makers facing similar challenges? There was an object lesson here. Many portable computers from U.S. companies had flat screens, for example, but most of the display designs came from the laboratories of Japan. Although</p>",
  "page-731": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">IBM would prosper—even if half of the innards of its PCs came from the Orient—many of the smaller American manufacturers might die. And even the larger domestic companies could suffer in the price ranges where computers were mere commodities; with flat displays and better memory chips, Nippon might again make us relive the transistor fiasco. I groped, poked, and wandered some more. And there in a dim corner I found the 1960s, too—in the form of a Nuvistor, another pygmy vacuum tube, another refinement of the obsolete. By the 1970s Heathkit was finally offering transistorized ham transmitters like the one I’d lend Eric. Heath still sold quite a few updated versions of the little HW-7. But now the amateur radio magazines seemed half filled by ads for solid-state equipment from Japan. How long until computer magazines looked the same?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I went upstairs. My parents, who for years had been</p>",
  "page-732": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">patiently awaiting the removal of the clutter from the crawl space, had second thoughts. What if I injured my back dragging the equipment to my car? Why couldn’t Eric and his father come for the tubes and chassis?</p><p>A passage from a novel—the name escaped me—came to mind. It was almost as if, by removing my old childhood toys, I were aging both myself and my parents.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I left the equipment at Eric’s after a meeting of the Kaypro writers group to which he and his father belonged. They lived in a white house in a greeny neighborhood high above most of Washington: a good location for an antenna, a great “QTH,” as Lynn Wilson would have put it in ham talk. The Meyers had filled the house with the paraphernalia of their obsessions. Downstairs Rima Meyer was at her spinning wheel; a huge loom dominated what normally would have been the dining room; and upstairs was the</p>",

Then we soldered up the Heathkit’s connectors and began hearing international Morse code and Spanish babble on the 15-meter band. He was amazed. I could make sense of the dots and dashes at twenty words per minute; he could copy at only a quarter of that speed. “Hey, don’t worry.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I snapped off the Heathkit. Eric and I went downstairs where Rima, a tiny woman named after the bird-girl in Green Mansions, was still at her spinning wheel. She dreamily looked up at us and proclaimed herself an anachronism. Children like Eric, she said, would be different from those before them—would think more abstractly in this video-game era. She wrote poetry; she heard voices; would the computer children</p>",
  "page-734": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">do the same? I thought of Rob Barnaby, the WordStar writer, who had said he heard “a voice from the back of my head”; it wasn’t the same back-of-the-head voice as a poet’s, but it was there, anyhow. Someday Eric might be another Barnaby.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Later that evening I demonstrated WordStar for the Meyers. Father and son agreed: WordStar moved words around faster than did Select, the word processor with which our Kaypros had originally come. I turned to Rima. “Computers are supposed to be very good for poets,” I said. “You can consider the possibilities. You can learn what words look like before you commit yourself to paper.” Rima listened politely, but I thought I might as well be showing off an electric guitar to a mandolin player. Gene and I discussed the Arthur Clarke connection. It was iffy. The telephone 254lines might not work; Clarke might be away on a business trip. Gene wouldn’t ghostwrite Eric’s questions for</p>",
  "page-735": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Clarke, but he did have one he hoped would make the list. “At the writer’s group,” Gene said, “this businessman was telling me how he fired his secretary when he got his computer.” How did Clarke feel about such situations? It was a common but acceptable question, I felt—one just as reasonable as any that science-fiction writers and philosophers might raise about the origin of the universe.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Two weeks later I rang Clarke, around eleven in the morning, Virginia time. A little sleepily, he answered. He was tired after a trip promoting the 2010 novel in the United States, and right now he could not recall me. “Remember,” I said, “we talked several months ago, and you said we could get together on the modem.” Clarke had phoned late one evening after I’d written him questions about WordStar, and in a sense we were now even; for my mind had drawn an absolute blank when this stranger had begun in a British accent, “David,</p>",
  "page-736": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">you’ll never guess who this is.” Well, I asked now, could we still get together on the modem? We’d run a test to be ready for the questions from Eric and others a few days later. “Call my computer store,” Clarke said. He was using BSTAM, alas, a communications program that didn’t work with my MODEM7 software. Imagine my disappointment. I’d been hoping for quick computer-to-computer contact, over 8,900 miles, with the inventor of the communications satellite; and now a mundane problem confronted us—a simple lack of software compatibility. BSTAM in some ways was a Rolls of a communications program, excellent for transmitting large blocks of data over long distances. In fact, Clarke had used it to send his New York publisher some changes in 2010. And yet, for communicating with me, his BSTAM disk was nothing but a worthless piece of plastic, because it snubbed MODEM7-style programs—perhaps the most common among micro</p>",
  "page-737": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">users. It was as if Clarke were a lonely billionaire in a chauffeured Rolls. His ride might be velvety, but he would never meet the commoners in the Chevy in the next lane.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After calling around the country, I finally located a review copy of BSTAM. Eric helped me test it out over the phone. “May I come over and watch you talk to Clarke?” he asked. I hesitated. Hadn’t Eric already modemed his questions to me? His being in my apartment seemed redundant. Then, however, I remembered my youth, when Lynn Wilson would invite me to his attic for DX sessions. It was like angling. Lynn might not snag those stations in New Zealand or Morocco, but it was still the electronic equivalent of treating a boy to a morning of trout fishing in a mountain stream. Now Arthur Clarke would be the new DX. Of course, the 255Rothman-Wilson analogy didn’t absolutely hold, for Eric knew more about</p>",
  "page-738": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">computers than I did. “Sure, Eric,” I said at last, “sure you can come.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With Eric and his mother watching a few days later, I punched the “0” and confidently said I wanted such-and-such number in Colombo, Sri Lanka. A tape-recorded voice soon came on with a New Yawkish accent, announcing that all circuits to Sri Lanka were busy. Well, what did I expect? Sri Lanka wasn’t one of the great centers of global communications. And yet it still seemed vaguely bizarre. Why shouldn’t Sri Lanka enjoy instant contact all the time with the whole world? Why not? Arthur Clarke lived there. Perhaps on my tenth try I finally heard the musical tone of Clarke’s number ringing. “Eureka!” I yelled. Once more Clarke himself answered. He warned me that he was rushing through a movie project and some books and was months behind in his correspondence; the most I could hope for in reply to the questions would be a series of</p>",
  "page-739": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">“Yeses,” “Nos,” and “Maybes.” That irked me. For my enterprise I deserved a response ahead of the other letter writers; in fact, you might say I wasn’t even a letter writer—I was a <em>modemer</em>. I glanced at Eric. He could tell the general direction of the conversation, and he looked just as downcast as I must have. Eric was even hoping—quite unrealistically, I believed—that Clarke might call him at home. “I am starting my own computer software company (R & D),” Eric had said in a preface to his questions, “and I hope to profit in this venture. I am enjoying your book 2001 and want to get 2010. I am also a novice-class ‘Ham.’ If you ever need any software or just want to chat, my home and work number is.... I also have interests in ROBOTICS and COMPUTER HARDWARE, and ELECTRONICS (etc.).” I’d reminded Eric that the technology might fail in my quest for answers to his questions; I hadn’t been so emphatic in warning that Clarke himself might fail</p>",
  "page-740": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">us.</p><p>“I’m going to need to test the modem, anyway,” Clarke said after a pause, however. He wanted to exchange ideas with an MGM/UA director for the movie sequel to 2001.</p><p>He gave me the number of his telephone with a modem hooked up, and then, several times, I again suffered the vagaries of global phone communications before a line finally opened up and I heard the familiar tone of a modem. I reached for my own modem, a slim blue box, and switched over from “TALK” to “DATA.” Then I hit the return key on my Kaypro, firing up the BSTAM program.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">My screen flashed word that the connection was in progress, and I was about to slap Eric on the back, but I waited, and quite rightly, for as the seconds wore on, the connection was <em>still</em> progressing. Something was amiss. By voice Clarke said my transmission 256hadn’t</p>",
  "page-741": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">registered in his computer memory—not even the mere existence of my electronic file.</p><p>I called Michael Scott, a technician at Business Computing International, Clarke’s New York computer store. He sent a Telex to Clarke. Was Clarke using the normal 300-baud modem speed matching mine? I learned a day or so later that he was. “Well,” I asked Michael, “how long has it been since Clarke last communicated with you [the store] through the modem?”</p><p>“Months.”</p><p>“Okay,” I said, “maybe he needs a refresher on how to set up the modem program.” Patiently, Michael ran through the procedures.</p><p>Half an hour later I again was braving surly operators and busy signals to place another call to Sri Lanka.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“What you want to do,” I told Clarke, “is type RXN</p>",
  "page-742": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">B:ODYCORR.TXT, then a carriage return, then select ANSWER when you see the prompt.” Clarke, however, hadn’t been doing it that way. We tried again, and for the next ten minutes my screen kept flashing dozens of confirmations of the connection.</p><p>Then our computer link broke.</p><p>I called Clarke back. Surely at least the start of the electronic file had shown up on the B disk, the one on which he was to store my questions. “No,” he said, “I don’t see it.” Clarke, it seems, had forgotten to put a floppy disk in his B drive. It was a very excusable mistake—this whole modeming procedure was still a novelty to him—and we failed yet another time even with Scott’s instructions followed exactly.</p><p>So a few days later I settled on another tack: getting Clarke a free Kaypro II.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Why not? Kaypro itself had once suggested that to me. It could do worse than to be able to say that Clarke</p>",
  "page-743": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and an MGM/UA director had used Kaypros to communicate during the creation of the 2010 film. I, in turn, might reach Clarke more easily if he was tapping away on a machine like mine. Besides, he eventually could give his Kaypro to the new Arthur C. Clarke Centre for Modern Technologies. The center was to promote high tech in the Third World, and Joseph Pelton, who was rounding up U.S. backers for the organization, liked the Kaypro idea. So did Clarke. And so did Peter Hyams at MGM/UA.</p><p>Hyams wasn’t just a well-known director with such credits as 257Capricorn One and The Star Chamber. He was the kind of person for whom I was writing this book—he had a problem open to possible solution by computer.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The problem was the need to consult closely with Clarke during the adaptation of the 2010 novel; how to overcome the time difference between Colombo, Sri</p>",
  "page-744": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Lanka, and Culver City, California?</p><p>“Some things work brilliantly when read but aren’t well suited to the screen,” Hyams said, and as a conscientious scriptwriter he didn’t want to make arbitrary changes to Clarke’s story. “I was interested in finding out what the author was thinking when he wrote certain things. And secondly I thought it was very, very important that Arthur C. Clarke be made to feel an important part of the making of this movie.” With rapport might come a greater understanding of the man and his books. Hearing of Hyams’s proposal to work together via</p><p>And yet Clarke’s location—some 9,350 miles from Culver City—also helped the struggle seem all the more worthwhile.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Because he’s twelve or thirteen hours away in time, it almost makes normal conversation impossible,” Hyams said. “Someone is always going to be speaking at</p>",
  "page-745": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">a very inconvenient hour for them. And there are some times when you don’t want to talk, and sometimes when you’re asking somebody for something, you want to think about something. It requires more than a quick answer.” Letters, though, just wouldn’t do: “I’ve gotten mail from him that’s almost a month old.” Hyams might have used telex or a similar system, but the costs would still be greater than a direct computer-to-computer link. Ideally, he could tap out memos on a computer, then whisk them to Clarke without a secretary taking the time to type them into another machine. Hyams was already comfortable with a Xerox 860 word processor. Like me, however, he realized that the link had more chance of succeeding with the two ends using the same computer systems—Kaypros in this case. Two hardworking Kaypro employees, Margaret Phanes and Clifford Odendhal, pushed through the project at their company. Within a week or so a Kaypro</p>",

Somehow Clarke’s Kaypro reached the airport. But he couldn’t pick it up because of the rioting, during which an arsonist burned down the house of one of his technical assistants.</p><p>“They’re swinging the jawbone again,” said an acquaintance of mine, alluding to a scene in 2001 where a man-ape kills another with the high tech of his era. It was not a slur on Sri Lanka—just general disgust over violence of any kind.

  "page-747": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">conspiring against me, I enjoyed a miraculous fluke. Arthur Clarke’s neighbor Susan Hayes, the wife of an American official in Colombo, was visiting Washington and would return to Sri Lanka soon; and through a member of the Kaypro writers group, Marcia Tyson, I passed on to her the written questions for Clarke to answer by phone if need be. I wasn’t cheating. It was perfectly in line with both the Marco Polo tradition and the spirit of this book; don’t ever shy away from paper backups.</p><p>I also supplied Clarke a disk of MODEM7, the public-domain program that I used—so that we needn’t worry about software differences if my program didn’t work with the one that Kaypro gave him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Kaypro, in fact, did provide Clarke with MODEM7-compatible software—a company program—but it wouldn’t run acceptably on Peter Hyams’s computer.

He berated me for not using the right number of data bits, the right stop bit, the right everything else in computerese. Chastened, I returned home, only to find that the program still wasn’t working reliably.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I took my Kaypro and software to a friend, a systems</p>",
  "page-749": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">analyst, an intelligent, learned man fond of aphorisms like “Even kings must obey the rules of mathematics.” Unfairly, cruelly, MITE still wasn’t running after five hours of his toil. My friend played by the rules; he’d based his whole career on following instruction manuals; he was the perfect man to help run the computer system of a hospital or bank. I was just the opposite. When it came to the laws of math or computer manuals, I was willing to turn criminal. In fact, that’s how I undeservedly succeeded at last—by flouting MITE’s instructions on connecting my computer and modem.</p><p>It was the first time in years that I’d used a soldering iron. I didn’t own a vise, even, so I placed the RS-232 connectors on an aluminum pie plate on the wooden floor of my apartment and breathed lead-poisoned fumes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The work was hot.

The program was excellent; the instructions were bewildering in places. Peter called a MITE distributor and traded insults. It was outrageous. We were not ordinary end users. Peter was a movie director trying to communicate with a famous novelist-scientist; and I, if an obscurity, was at least around to chronicle whatever abuse Peter suffered.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">What would average computer users have done? Without other MITE owners to share their problems, they would have been up the creek. The whole ordeal was a potent argument for user groups; in fact, you might say that Clarke, Peter, and I were a three-member one. Clarke, meanwhile, was reportedly suffering a</p>",
  "page-751": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">disk-drive problem. He may have enjoyed sympathy, however, from another user—nearby; an American in Sri Lanka owned a Kaypro. Of course, the ordeal was still another argument for easier-to-master software.</p><p>Finally, it happened: the Great Modeming—more than six 260months after Clarke had first phoned me from Sri Lanka.</p><p>Hyams and Clarke started typing messages to each other, and I knew my own Great Modeming would succeed. But a problem lingered even now. Colombo and Culver City couldn’t send already-typed material to each other’s unattended machines.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">So one of Clarke’s first messages to the MGM/UA Kaypro wasn’t exactly “What hath God wrought?” It was something in the spirit of “Tell \\\\ to fix that software or I’m going to throw the computer in a river. And tell \\\\ that Sri Lanka has many rivers.” A furious Hyams and Rothman phoned Odendhal, who</p>",
  "page-752": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">promptly contacted the distributor. Contrite, the MITE man apologized and gave Hyams the guidance he needed.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Clarke-Hyams link was now in place. It hadn’t been easy. The two men were each using a $1,595 computer, a modem selling for several hundred dollars, and a communications program listing for more than $175, and Peter’s new printer cost several hundred; and those expenses normally would have been only the beginning. Kaypro had set up the software and offered other consultant-style services; Clarke used his own technician. If Average Company, Inc., had duplicated the computer link on both sides of the Pacific, the project might have exceeded $5,000. And yet clearly the technical hurdles seemed surmountable and the rewards worthwhile. Two weeks into the link Hyams had only one complaint—the difficulty of reaching an international operator at times to place calls. And in</p>",
  "page-753": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">future years that problem would lessen as special computer links let Telenet spread into the world’s poorer countries. An attachment to make the Sri Lankan phone system compatible would cost the government several thousand dollars. And the expense to Clarke and Hyams would be perhaps $60 an hour—no great barrier, considering that they could transmit 1,000-word computer files in a fraction of that cost using 300-baud modems. With faster modems they might end up spending still less.</p><p>More important to Hyams right now, however, was the friendship he was building with Clarke—so important to the success of the film.</p><p>“I think we’re kind of linked in a strange way,” Peter said. “He’s written some lovely and sweet things. It’s strangely intimate. You’re just getting daily mail. It has some really wonderful advantages that letters have over telephone conversations.</p>",
  "page-754": "<p>“The kinds of questions that I’m asking him and the kinds of things I’m saying are things you don’t really say off the top of your head. You know, ‘What do you think about so-and-so?’ and you sit down and compose the answer and you write it back. Some of the stuff is purely personal. Some of it is not. I want him to experience the making of this movie. There are a lot of logistical 261details. I’ve spoken to some people that Arthur’s recommended I speak to. There are things to do with everything, from marketing to plans I have, to changes I want to make, to What does he think of certain things? to technical areas of the film that he can be enormous help with.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Clarke, using British spelling, modemed to me that the “connextion” with Peter Hyams was “invaluable. We are on exactly the other side of the clock, so I leave my machine on ANSWER with a file for him when I go to bed, which is about the time he goes to MGM,</p>",
  "page-755": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and when I get down to breakfast, there’s his answer on the disk.” If Peter worked late at night, the two men might save their “conversation” on computer disk so “there will be a complete record of our collaboration. It’s truly fantastic, like WordStar. I just can’t imagine how I ever managed without it. My big worry is that as more and more of my friends get plugged in, I’ll never be able to get away from the keyboard.”</p><p>A few days before Clarke sent his written answers for Eric Meyer and the others, he phoned him just as Eric had hoped. “I wouldn’t want to disappoint the boy,” Clarke said later. The Clarke-Meyer conversation was brief—words to the effect that Clarke would be in Washington in 1984 and he wished Eric luck in the future—but it served its purpose. “It’s the first time I’ve ever had an international call,” Eric said. “My first phone DX!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">My computer DX reached me one Saturday</p>",
  "page-756": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">morning at nine, an uneventful occurrence except for a broken telephone connection when I dialed Clarke back to start the modeming. Our two Kaypros clicked the next try. I received a prepared file from Clarke of about one thousand words, and afterwards we tapped out some 250 words:</p><p>Q. When will you be coming to Washington so I can tell Eric, who naturally will want to attend your speech?</p><p>A. I am afraid it will be a very private affair, as it takes place in the White House! But I expect to be in Washington in late April.</p><p>Q. I am planning to call my ergonomics chapter “The Hal Syndrome,” and if you’ve used that phrase before, I’d like to give you credit.</p><p>A. I don’t recall ever using the term, but it’s a good idea, and you’re welcome, anyway.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That’s part of the conversation with the typos cleaned up—on-line typing isn’t for the vain. Clarke</p>",

Hyams was fast, too, reaching maybe eighty or ninety per minute on good days; and yet as Peter pointed out, typing speed didn’t matter that much, since you normally would compose at leisure, then squirt out your prepared file.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Clarke-Rothman connection ran just fourteen minutes and cost $25.11 on my phone bill—a good case for the economy of global computer communications. I didn’t know what Clarke’s rates might be. But if I’d given a thousand words to a Telex service in Washington, D.C., a one-way message to Sri Lanka would have totaled some $125. And if I could have afforded my own Telex machine? Well, the connect charges alone still would have exceeded $60. Moreover, my $25.11 charge was for a 300-baud connection, a slowpoke one by some business computer standards. With a 1,200-baud link—a strong possibility since the</p>",
  "page-758": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">connection had proved so reliable for Clarke and Hyams at 300 baud—my phone bill might have been well under $15 even on a weekday. And with everything sent already typed, it might have been between $5 and $10. Imagine the thousands of dollars a company could save using micros instead of Telex for regular communications with faraway offices.</p><p>In one of the questions sent there Marco Polo fashion, Eric asked if computers someday would replace secretaries who took dictation. Could the machines display the words on their screens and electronically police spelling and grammar? “We will certainly get computers that can take dictation,” Clarke replied by modem, “and this may lead to two desirable results—better elocution and rationalisation of spelling.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Yes, yes. Maybe someday American and British computers could even spell alike. Although Eric’s question was a very good one, it was passé in many</p>",
  "page-759": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">technical circles, as he himself must have known. Articles were already appearing in micro magazines about low-cost computers that could recognize simple commands like SAVE (to preserve material on a disk). One of the big problems with speech recognition was usability with different voices. But I had no doubt that practical machines with a vocabulary fit for the business world would be taking dictation by 2001.</p><p>The keyboard would remain, however. Not everyone would want to dictate; I suspected even two decades from now I’d still prefer the pleasure of letting my fingers linger over the keys. Then again, how did I know? Just a few years ago I could have seen myself at only a <em>typewriter</em> keyboard.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">As for spelling checkers—well, there again the basic technology was already around. I myself would be proofing this chapter with The WORD Plus, a 45,000-word electronic dictionary that would flag the places</p>",
  "page-760": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">where my spellings contradicted it. Not that The WORD Plus would ever replace proofreaders at The New Yorker. It would let you use “his” when you meant “this”; it was absolutely incapable of considering spellings in context. Even by 2001 the checkers might lack that capability. But eventually they would respond perfectly to context, as would grammar checkers. That might require artificial intelligence, the ability of computers to reason independently without their humans laying out the machines’ tasks in detail. But the day would come.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Of course even the best prophets could err. In his 1945 article entitled “Extra-Terrestrial Relays: Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?” Clarke predicted communications satellites but missed by a mile in another area. “It seems unlikely that we will have to wait as much as twenty years,” he said then, “before atomic-powered rockets are developed....” Still,</p>",
  "page-761": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">I appreciated Clarke’s general philosophy of prediction: Experts are more often wrong in saying something <em>can’t</em> be done than in saying that it <em>can</em>.</p><p>“Do you think there will ever be a HAL?” Eric asked Clarke.</p><p>“Yes,” Clarke said, “HAL will arrive—but not by 2001!”</p><p>I agreed. But confusingly, HAL wouldn’t necessarily be a pure-bred silicon creation; I could see him as a hybrid of silicon chips and biochips, or maybe just the latter.</p><p>Created by an organic process, the biochips might have complexity and power far beyond those of old-fashioned machines with silicon.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">What’s more, instead of a machine acting like a man, scientists might help join men with machines, with everyone receiving brain implants at birth. Men might turn into Hal before Hal became a man. For years</p>",
  "page-762": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">science-fiction writers had been predicting cyborgs, man-machine unions.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In some ways, humans might forever defy emulation. “Even 264with computers’ vast memories, I’m skeptical as to whether a machine could give judgments based on ethics,” said another of the questioners, Jerry terHorst. “How can executives live with this limitation? Might computers have a way of taking the sharp edge off ethical questions? Quite often you can put things in a machine or say things to a machine, but maybe—because of the way it operates—you must conform to its system. You can’t very well couch an ethical question for the machine, because I don’t think a computer can weigh it ethically. It can certainly weigh it procedurally, but whether it can weigh it ethically is another question. I’m wondering whether computers might get in the way of having to make some of the ethical decisions that businesses are</p>",
  "page-763": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">always required to make.”</p><p>Clarke replied, “It will certainly be some time before computers understand ethics (not too many humans do, for that matter), but <em>in the long run</em> it is impossible to rule out any aspect of human activity which cannot be reproduced or at least imitated by computer to any desired degree of precision. Of course, some things will be too complicated to be worth doing.” Elsewhere in the response Clarke did say: “I know nothing about corporate or any other form of management, but obviously in principle computers can assist decision making greatly. However—GIGO!” Garbage in, garbage out!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Already electronic decision programs were available for businessmen, helping them consider financial factors—but in most cases, not very much more. Besides, the people who most needed guidance from “ethical” software would be the least likely to use it.</p>",
  "page-764": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Imagine Richard Nixon booting up a disk to ponder if he should cover up Watergate.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">All this wasn’t an abstraction for terHorst. He himself had resigned as press secretary in a disagreement with Gerald Ford over the Nixon pardon. Now he worked as Washington public-affairs director for another Ford, the car company. It undoubtedly had banks of computers, and like any other automakers’, they must be toting up the costs of adding various safety precautions to cars. Critics of the auto industry charged that manufacturers considered only their ledgers—the cost of the precautions versus that of lawsuits. Would software someday weigh the ethical issues along with the numbers, and <em>should</em> it? That was hardly a question just for the auto industry. What about a construction company evaluating building materials of different strengths? Or a book publisher weighing its profitability against the menace to public health that</p>",
  "page-765": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">would result from publication of a fad diet book. I was reactionary enough to consider those final decisions forever beyond 265the realm of even computers as sophisticated as HAL. In the future, though, how many executives would feel that way? Jerry terHorst’s ethics question was easily my favorite.</p><p>He also asked, “What about the general issue of trust among people communicating by computer? Can people make policy, sign contracts, settle multimillion questions without shaking hands? You can have two people with computers in different locations calling up the same statistics from the same memory bank. Yet isn’t it possible that the necessary trust may not occur until the two get together in person?”</p><p>“Your point that people must meet to establish trust is one theme of my novel Imperial Earth,” Clarke replied. “After that, they can work together through telecommunications.</p>",
  "page-766": "<p>“I had unexpected confirmation of this idea from a visiting reader who happened to be the Russian ambassador-at-large in charge of the Indian Ocean. He said, ‘You’re quite right. You have to look into the other fellow’s eyes before you can negotiate.’”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In Imperial Earth a man from a moon of Saturn visits Washington in 2276 to celebrate the U.S. quincentennial and cultivate his family’s terrestrial political contacts. Wreckers have razed the original Watergate complex—over the objections of the Democrats, who wanted it saved as a national monument—but in many ways politicians and statesmen are the same as in the darkest twentieth century. They seek personal contact with each other. “Only after that contact, with its inevitable character evaluation, had been made, and the subtle links of mutual understanding and common interest established,” writes Clarke, “could one do business by</p>",
  "page-767": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">long-distance communication with any degree of confidence.”</p><p>A booster of telecommuting might nod. He’d insisted that we meet <em>face-to-face</em>, and I suspected I could have enjoyed slightly better cooperation from a few other interviewees for this book if we had been in the same rooms. Wires and satellites could never eliminate travel.</p><p>Granted, some researchers might say the next year that people tended to use stronger words in computer conferences, perhaps to make up for the lack of body language and other visual clues. Reportedly, the decisions from such conferences tended to be more radical—involving much more risk or not enough—than those made face-to-face.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Just the same, computer “meetings” could greatly reduce travel once the people at the various ends had established the basic trust. Clarke had written two</p>",
  "page-768": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">decades ago, “The business lunch of the 266future could be conducted perfectly well with the two halves of the table ten thousand miles apart; all that would be missing would be the handshakes and exchange of cigars.”</p><p>That might or not be with television contact. The absence of it, however, wouldn’t be the ultimate disaster. In concentrating on the other person’s <em>message</em>, you might be less vulnerable to misleading clues from facial expression, body movement, or clothing. Clarke himself enjoyed creating different personae for different audiences; once his sarong had shaken up an IBM convention. A Washington reporter described him at another time as “a paunchy fellow” with thinning hair, “math-teacher glasses, discreet hearing aid ... red velvet slippers and unbelted pants” who looked “like some kind of GS-12 from the Bureau of Poultry Audits. And he wants you to see his Kermit the Frog doll.”</p>",
  "page-769": "<p>Beyond reducing the opportunity for visual distractions, long-distance contact by phone or computer offered another advantage in my opinion. You could reach more people in a given time to confirm their facts; you weren’t twiddling your thumbs in cabs and airport lobbies or wearily working the horn locally from a hotel room with a bed fit for a steel-spined dwarf.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That still left the question of what kind of office you would talk to the world from. Margaret Phanes of Kaypro wanted to know. The week Margaret asked about the office of 2001, she said she was in the middle of reading Clarke’s novel Rendezvous with Rama. In her opinion, Clarke brought about “synchronicity.” He himself, in fact, had once told of “preposterous” coincidences in his own life, and he’d peopled Imperial Earth with characters like “George Washington,” a twenty-third-century Virginian who lived on a</p>",
  "page-770": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">museum’s plantation named Mt. Vernon. If “synchronicity” or other coincidences had worked for Dickens, then why not Clarke and Phanes? Or Rothman? Trying to puzzle out some technical details of my computer-to-computer link with Clarke, I’d run into two noncelebrities who had met him. And what about his neighbor—visiting Washington—through whom I’d passed the questions from Margaret and the others? Coincidence needn’t be mystical. I was happy enough for it simply to be useful.</p><p>Replying to Margaret’s questions about what the office would 267be like in 2001, Clarke had a problem. For decades he had been working at home. “My ‘office,’ if you can call it that—it looks like a snake-pit with all the cables on the floor—is just ten feet from my bedroom. I can appreciate your questions are very important, but they’re outside my frame of reference.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Clarke may have replied in a limited way to Phanes,</p>",
  "page-771": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">however, when he answered a question from Seymour Rubinstein.</p><p>He’d asked Clarke about the possibility of briefcase computer tapping into worldwide networks to do complicated processing of information. Just how would that affect people?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Years ago Clarke had said a business eventually wouldn’t even need “an address or a central office—only the equivalent of a telephone number. For its files and records will be space rented in the memory units of computers that could be located anywhere on earth. The information stored in them could read off on high-speed printers whenever any of the firm’s offices needed it.” there may no longer be any question of ‘micros in the office.’ The office will be in the micro—and <em>that</em> will be in an attaché case.”Rubinstein himself already knew that Epson was about to market its little lap-size machine with WordStar built into the read-only</p>",
  "page-772": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">memory. )</p><p>Rob Barnaby, the WordStar programmer, asked a slightly overlapping question covered by the same answer. There was something else for them from Clarke, however—his thanks.</p><p>“I am happy to greet the geniuses who made me a born-again writer,” he said. “Having announced my retirement in 1978, I now have six books in the works and two portables—all through WordStar.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">James Watt, the descendant of the Scottish inventor, also figured to an extent in Clarke’s work, in the sense that the Haunted Book Shop sold it. “A computer disk the size of a phonograph record can hold about 54,000 frames of pictures,” Watt observed 268in his questions, “enough for a large encyclopedia. Does that mean we’ll see the end of going into a bookstore and buying a best-seller? Are we going to lose the printed word as we know it today? Will ‘book’ buying become a</p>",
  "page-773": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">computerized activity? Will I call up XYZ computer firm and then peruse disks at my leisure?”</p><p>“Nothing will ever replace books,” Clarke reassured him. “They can’t be matched for convenience, random access, nonvolatile memory (unless dropped in the bath), low power consumption, portability, etc.</p><p>“But information networks will supplement them and replace whole categories, e.g., encyclopedias and telephone directories (as is being planned in France).”</p><p>Clarke was more sanguine about Watts’s fear that computerized shopping might “dehumanize us” and clerks might vanish. He said, “I believe personal service will become more and more important and hopefully more and more available as older occupations disappear. We’ll ‘window-shop’ through home terminals but will still discuss important products with salesmen, even if they’re hundreds of kilometers away!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The seventh questioner, Lynn Wilson, had worked</p>",
  "page-774": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">several decades for the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company, only to see computers do away with the rotary switches he had so lovingly attended.</p><p>“They’ve sent all my equipment to the smelter’s to reclaim the metal,” he said. “I don’t know if anyone’s still in the building. Maybe a few times a week someone goes by. The equipment tests itself twenty-four hours a day and flashes a red light for the serviceman next time he’s there.” Just a few boxes had replaced the long rows of devices that connected the dial phones in the area of Alexandria, Virginia.</p><p>But Lynn didn’t feel any futility. The telephone and teletype themselves had superseded another invention he used—the Morse Code telegraph.</p><p>He’d pounded out messages at up to forty words per minute for the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad, and he still recalled an old saying reflecting his pride in his craft:</p>",
  "page-775": "<p>“If a telegram takes more than twenty-four hours to be delivered, it has whiskers.”</p><p>My friend had a feel for the scraps of history. For years he’d kept a Teletype message announcing the Third Reich’s surrender, and I asked about the ARC-5 receiver that he’d given me: could it really have flown over Germany? “Go to the Air and Space Museum in Washington,” Lynn said, “and you’ll see a cockpit with an ARC-5. I’ve even seen an ARC-5 with a .50-caliber bullet hole right through it.”</p><p>Lynn was hardly a foe of every piece of post-ARC-5 technology. In late 1983 he hoped to be among the hams talking on the two-meter wavelength to an astronaut aboard the space shuttle.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Aren’t computers turning people into useless objects against their will?” Lynn asked Clarke. Gene Meyer, Eric’s father, of course had wanted Eric to ask a somewhat similar question. But it meant more coming</p>",
  "page-776": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">from Lynn.</p><p>“Computers eliminate people, who take vacations, sick leave, and retirement,” he said. “I myself haven’t suffered. I took voluntary retirement at full pension at sixty-two. But computers were why I left then instead of sixty-five. I would have had to go to school for three years, and by then I would have been ready for regular retirement. So it didn’t make sense for me to stay. But not everyone can retire at full pension when the new technology takes over. What do you do about the people being forced out? What’s the answer?”</p><p>“Anyone who can be turned into a useless object against his/her will <em>is</em> one!” Clarke said. “You obviously weren’t.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That was too pat an answer for me. The other day I’d talked to my old state editor, who’d visited Lorain, Ohio, west of Cleveland on Lake Erie. He feared that Lorain might become a husk of a town. A decade ago,</p>",
  "page-777": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">when I’d been a reporter there, more than eight thousand had worked at the U.S. Steel mills, and Dick worried that the company might pull out of Lorain except for a bare-bones plant employing just a few hundred. Downtown, he’d seen dozens of shattered store windows. Oddly, however, the newspaper enjoyed some new subscribers—Dick said some of his friends could afford to do little more than watch television and read. Were Dick’s friends to be shrugged off as “useless objects”? In Imperial Earth Clarke had told of stringent population control, of an American Midwest replanted with forests, of steel mills neatly preserved as museums; but three centuries earlier, Lorain untidily abounded with angry, idle men. Cheap steel imports were one threat to them. So, perhaps, was the eagerness of many steel-company officers to pour their capital into more profitable industries. But computers and other high tech also had helped deprive Lorain of some steel jobs.</p>",
  "page-778": "<p>In the future, however, couldn’t even a factory technician telecommute—overseeing robots from home and using them to turn out custom-crafted products requiring a human “touch”? Ideally, America in 2001 would be producing something besides “information,” 270Big Macs, and look-alike toasters. And ideally, too, average workers could afford to enjoy the cornucopia. In fact, widespread genetic enhancement of IQs might <em>eventually</em> make everyone capable of appreciating high tech at a high level, so that “workers” in the old sense disappeared.

Not after you’re experienced, anyway. Some rival word-processing programs have menus that bog everyone down, beginners and old pros. But not WordStar.

If you’re <em>just</em> turning out short business letters, for instance, and don’t want to store them on your disk, try something else. WordStar makes you electronically save your words there before you can print anything. And that takes time.

The best electronic filing cabinets, for instance, boast clever wrinkles to make it easier for you to enter new categories of information or to change individual records. Consider this story, which is true, about a reporter whom an editor was on the verge of firing. The severance pay was ready. The editor changed his mind at the last minute, however, and the final check stayed in his desk. Then, not long after, the paper’s auditor stormed into the city room. “Why didn’t you fire the son of a bitch?” he asked. “Now we’ll have to spend all this time straightening out the records.” Had the paper had a good, powerful electronic filing system, the nonfiring would have been a little less traumatic to the auditor.</p><p>FEWER CHANCES FOR BOTCH-UPS</p>",

Arthur Clarke, for instance, complains mildly of the underlining procedure. If he turns on the underlining, he’ll occasionally forget to turn it off, meaning that, unwittingly, he’ll underline everything that follows.

Suppose you’re about to erase an entire file; that is, a whole document that you’ve worked on: say, a letter or a sales report. If you press the control key and the letters “K” and 307“J,” WordStar won’t act immediately. Instead, it will ask, “Name of File to Delete?” You can even get out of most commands before they’re executed. It’s simple. Just hit the “Control” and “U” buttons, then the “Escape” one. WordStar, in short, is good for the hotheaded.

  "page-908": "<p>First the basics. I myself prefer a program like WordStar Version 3.3, which is in the “get-what-you-see” tradition and shows your copy on screen almost exactly as it will be printed. But Mary makes a good argument for a rival with a different philosophy. WordStar 2000 in fact helps her case. It now has many of the features that her dear Perfect Writer came out with first, including split screens. Interestingly, however, the new Perfect is more useful to the “get-what-you-see” crowd than is the older version, while WordStar 2000 is <em>less</em> get what you see in an important way than 3.3 is. At least that’s true of the WordStar 2000 previewed to dealers. During a demo, anyhow, a MicroPro employee couldn’t coax 2000 into displaying double-spacing conveniently on screen even though we could have double-spaced on paper.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Where does the increasing resemblance between Perfect Writer and the WordStar family fit in the cosmic</p>",
  "page-909": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">scheme? I’ll recklessly generalize:</p><p>The word processors of the world are becoming like refrigerators; all the deluxe models will have the equivalents of automatic defrosters and ice makers and butter warmers and lettuce crispers. More of the new wrinkles will be marginal. And the surviving companies will be the ones that can explain and exploit the differences and support their customers the best.</p><p>Not everyone likes butter warmers. As noted before, WordStar 3112000 isn’t an unalloyed improvement for me, and the “perfecter” Perfect in some ways disappoints Mary.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The older WordStar lets you move to the left of a line with the combination of the Control key and the letters Q and S or Control-QS. A touch typist could do this almost instantly. WordStar 2000, on the other hand, uses Control-CL. CL stands for “cursor left,” CR for “cursor right,” and mnemonic commands like those</p>",
  "page-910": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">are indeed easier to keep in your head, especially if you use a program only occasionally. On the other hand, the new strokes are harder for a touch typist—this one, anyway. Likewise, Mary wishes that Perfect Writer’s new commands were a bit more logical, especially to old Perfect Writer hands.</p><p>Concluding, Mary says Perfect Writer users with 64K machines shouldn’t junk them to buy more powerful computers just to run the new version. My thinking is basically the same about WordStar 2000 versus WordStar 3.3. The older program isn’t as good as 2000 in some cases; for instance, when you could use built-in memo format to make temporary employees more productive. But 3.3 is still terrific for people <em>without such needs</em>, and I’ll think long and hard before I myself change.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mary’s impressions and mine are typical of many veteran users of software who can’t stomach features</p>",

Luckily, the questions usually run in the “How the heck do you do X?” vein, or I might have to reveal that I’m only a good-hearted writer.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now the Perfect Writer people have released a brand-new version of their already powerful program, and I think I’m in trouble. The new, revised version of Perfect</p>",
  "page-912": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">incorporates some radical changes—sweeping enough to demand 128K of RAM (and IBM PC DOS to operate. (Actually, after claiming that the new Perfect can edit documents of up to 100 pages, the manual states that “with 64K of RAM you will be able to edit documents about 5 pages long,” so I assume that the new Perfect takes up about 56K of RAM—not being familiar with the PC’s way of juggling numbers, I can’t tell exactly. I’m in trouble because I won’t be the reigning Sibyl anymore unless I can figure out how 312to buy a PC-compatible computer with a decent keyboard (most PC keyboards are horrid and still do things like pay bills and buy the occasional loaf of bread and jug of wine.) ) )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The most radical of the changes is that the new Perfect Writer now uses what it calls “pop-up command menus” during editing. When you hit the Escape key, a small (about one-twelfth of the screen “top menu” will</p>",
  "page-913": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">superimpose itself over your text, as close to your cursor as possible, three characters away to the left or right. It lists your choices for subsidiary menus, which eventually lead you to the command you want. )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Nearly every command has been changed, so that those of us who are used to the old Perfect Writer must learn the editing commands all over again. The new manual (haters of the old one will be glad to learn that the index is now at the back where it belongs and those frustrating Roman numerals are gone explains with a straight face that the pop-up menus exist so that you “don’t have to memorize command sequences.” Of course, if you plan to use Perfect Writer more than once a year or so, you’re going to memorize the commands, anyway; and so, as the manual airily says, the Control key does everything the Escape key does, identically; the only difference is that you “bypass” the top menu—because, it says, you aren’t always going to want to see</p>",
  "page-914": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">it. Mind you, if you use the Control key, you’ll see every menu but the top menu, anyway. )</p><p>Is this enough reason to change all the commands but one—to bypass <em>one</em> menu?</p><p>To me, this is not an improvement over the old Perfect Writer—not unless you actually <em>like</em> added keystrokes. All the old two- and three-keystroke commands are now three-keystroke commands at least, and often four or five. This is progress? The new Perfect Writer has indeed taken pity on us and assigned to the PC’s function keys twenty frequently used commands, so that if, for example, you don’t feel like keystroking Escape-DS-Carriage-Return to save your document and continue working on it (Control-X-Control-S in the old PW), you can keystroke SHIFT-Function Key 9-Carriage Return. Whoopee.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Let us not carp too much about what strikes me as suspiciously similar to kludge, since the new Perfect</p>",
  "page-915": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Writer is as fast or faster than the old Perfect Writer. We’re probably only talking about a few microseconds, mind you, but it still seems to me that the execution of Perfect’s new commands is usually close to instantaneous. This is a thing to marvel at when you compare Perfect Writer to WordStar 3.3, where unless you have a specially speeded-up version with specially reassigned 313command keys and fingers with a lightning-fast touch, it takes forever to execute certain commands (well, ten or twenty seconds and perceptible time (say, one or two seconds even if you do have the speed. But I still say the 50, 100, or 200 percent additional keystrokes are a pain in the you know where. The program may be faster, but the human being is now 50, 100, or 200 percent slower. ) )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One improvement in particular is one to run through the streets singing about: Perfect Formatter has been incorporated into Perfect Printer in the main</p>",

The main failing of the old Perfect was whether or not you were using the document design capabilities, you had very little idea of what the final product was going to look like.

The exact command sequence for underlining a sentence is Escape-T-B (begin marking), Escape-F-S (go to the end of the sentence), Escape-A-M-U (underline the marked area).

You could underline a sentence just by starting with one Control-P-S and ending it with another. What’s the big deal, Mary? Your described procedure would apply only to material that you underlined <em>after</em> you wrote it. All those Control-Fs do is make the cursor jump a word ahead. <em>Grrr!</em> Then again, maybe I’m simply a more decisive underliner. I <em>know</em> what I want!

(However, the process is more complicated than it used to be.)</p><p>◾ You can flush right material on screen—useful for the what-you-see-is-what-you-get feature.</p>",
  "page-920": "<p>◾ You can more or less paginate on screen—although this instruction is only good for the what-you-see-etc. editing; it’s useless for the document-design mode (@@ commands).</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">◾ You can use the “Search” function to search not only the document you’re working in now but any and all other document files on your diskette. This strikes me as amazingly handy for editing multiple documents when you can’t remember what the name of the other document is or where the reference is you’re thinking of. For example, suppose you’re writing to Joyce Davenport and you want to add a paragraph from a letter you wrote to James T. Kirk but you can’t remember more than that it was about artichokes. You would invoke “search document”; the prompter then asks you what you’re searching for, and you say, “Artichokes.” Pretty soon you have a list of the documents 315the word “artichokes” appears in, and</p>",

I took it for granted that he would suggest buying by mail in many instances; but what advice, based on his MicroPro days and other experiences, did he offer about buying “3-D,” as he called it—buying in the flesh from a store, in other words?</p><p>“The best place to go if you’re buying software retail,” he said, “is to someone who’s doing a training seminar in the same program you’re buying.

You want him around to answer your questions later on.</p><p>This principle would especially hold true when buying software from franchised stores. Some stores may be excellent. Others, however, as Park pointed out, “may be a bunch of small businessmen who used to sell shoes and bought into a franchise at an exorbitant price.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Offering, obviously, a mail-order perspective, Park said that the computer-store managers he knew didn’t always know their software lines because there were so</p>",

Trying out WordStar with Osbornes, I’d run across sales reps who couldn’t show me how to make printouts of the letters on the tiny black-and-white screen. Some sales reps were “terminally” dumb. Others were bright and helpful but too busy selling too many machines to pick up the basics of WordStar and other heavy-duty programs. WordStar wasn’t <em>that</em> hard to master, however. I wondered how stores could counsel customers if they couldn’t even train sales reps.</p><p>I asked Park about mail-order software.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">croPro,” he said, “I told people, ‘Don’t buy by mail.

Of course, as stated earlier, you’ll ideally select your hardware <em>after</em> you’ve chosen your general range of software. Park says most people don’t fully “realize the implications” of the software they’re ordering “because they haven’t thought of it yet.” There’s the old problem, of course. How do you know you’ll like the software until you’ve tried it at leisure? And then you normally can’t get your money back.

  "page-944": "<p>There are a number of data-base programs on the market for personal computers, with new entries coming in daily. The MicroPro people—parents of the famous (or infamous WordStar—have come out with a dandy of their own: InfoStar, which can sit up, roll over, and whistle Dixie. )</p><p>What does one look for in a data-base program? To a certain extent, of course, it depends on what one wants.

Here are some terms and ideas to keep in</p>",
  "page-945": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">mind:</p><p>◻ The data base, or data file, contains all your entries. InfoStar allows any number of data files per diskette; others allow only one. Score one for InfoStar.</p><p>◻ The data record covers <em>all</em> the information you store for each entry into your data base. How big will your program allow each data record to be? How many data records will your program allow before it seizes up and refuses to accept any more? Will the program warn you that as of X moment its files are full and it won’t accept any more records? (I once spent two days trying to figure out why Perfect Filer was giving me back nothing but garbage before I thought to check and see whether my diskette was full.)</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">InfoStar will allow you a maximum of 65,535 data records per file. By way of comparison, Perfect Filer will accept as many data records as the diskette will hold—about a thousand if your diskettes will hold 200K of</p>",
  "page-946": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">memory and you’ve filled up your data entry screen with lots and lots of data fields; probably a skillion if you only have one one-character data field and a lot of disk capacity. The new program dBASE III will allow over a billion records or <em>two</em> billion characters in a file—again, up to the limit of your disk space.</p><p>◻ The data fields are the building blocks to your data record. Some obvious attributes a data field may have are that it is alphabetic (letters only); numeric (numbers only); or alphanumeric</p><p>(okay, you guessed it). That’s about all the simplest data base programs allow—but here’s where InfoStar is an absolute champ. Some of the attributes InfoStar will allow:</p><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">The field may only contain certain numbers and/or letters—for example, if you’re typing in a state abbreviation and type “IT” when you mean “IN,” InfoStar will stop you and tell you that’s not</li></ul>",
  "page-947": "<ul><li class=\"split-li \">acceptable. (It does this by checking what is called an authority file and comparing the authority’s contents with your input. Handy-dandy!)</li><li>The field will enter itself based on your previous entries. For example, you can enter that your customer wants 47 of your code number W889AA (widgets), two entries; and InfoStar can look up the price of widgets, multiply that by 47, look up the sales tax for the state you inputted earlier, multiply your subtotal by the amount of sales tax, and all by itself enter the name of the product, the subtotal, the amount of the sales tax, and the total—zip-zip-zip-zip, four entries, all done by the computer rather than by you and all done in a flash. The first time I tried it, I was startled into yelling, “Wa-hoo!”</li><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">The field can be a constant. For example, if your data record contains years, you can tell InfoStar to enter “198” automatically, and you only have to</li></ul>",
  "page-948": "<ul><li class=\"split-li \">enter “4,” “5,” or whatever.</li><li>The field can automatically shift cases for you. For example, you can type in “new york, ny,” and InfoStar will insert into the data record “New York, NY.”</li><li>The field can insist that whatever you type in is identical two times in a row or it won’t save the data record—useful if you deal with complex numbers that have to be right.</li><li>The field can be required—something that you have to enter, or InfoStar won’t let you go on.</li></ul><p>Oh, and these are only examples! I guess I’m just a simple country girl, but I was amazed and thrilled by all that InfoStar could do with its data fields.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">◻ How big are your data fields allowed to be? How many fields are you allowed to have? InfoStar allows you a maximum of 245 fields per record, and a maximum of 255 characters per field—it comes out to</p>",
  "page-949": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">a maximum of 62,475 characters per data record. (Perfect Filer, again by way of comparison, theoretically allows 70 fields with a combined total of 1,024 characters. On the other hand, the one time I tried to test this 326limit with Perfect Filer, the program went comatose on me. I do wonder whether an InfoStar data record that was 61K in size might mean you would get fewer than 64K data records into your data base. On the other hand, who could imagine a 61K data record on a personal computer? It is, after all, about the same size as a 60-page letter to your Aunt Millie, and how often do you write 60-page letters to your Aunt Millie? )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">◻ Once you have data in your data base, the sort keys determine how you can get the data out again. Do you want to get the information out in alphabetical order by name? Numerical order by ZIP code or phone number? Some combination of the two? (For example, you might, if the information is in your data records,</p>",
  "page-950": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">want to sort your friends by who is left-handed, who gave you a Christmas card last year, when their birthdays are, or all of the above. How many sort keys will the data base allow? What kinds? How long does it take the program to do a sort? )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">To take a primitive example, Perfect Filer allows you up to five sort keys (alphabetical order by sister’s name, for example; numerical order by ZIP code; both; numeric order by phone number; all three; and so on). Perfect Filer will also generate up to twenty subsets from which to sort. (Left-handed Republicans, female plumbers, all those who owe you more than three dollars—you name it. And it will also let you have up to 40 list format fields—that is, it will allow you to generate up to 40 different kinds of list (all left-handed female plumbers who live on the West Coast). InfoStar, on the other hand, will allow you 32 sort fields, which is a few more than 5; but it doesn’t have any subsets per se</p>",
  "page-951": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and doesn’t seem to allow you more than one list format. On the other hand, the range of “logical expressions” it allows is amazing, and provided you understand BASIC (InfoStar’s data are written in CBASIC fairly well, you can attain heights of efficiency Perfect Filer couldn’t even dream of (more on this immediately). ) )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">◻ What kinds of calculations will your program do, and when does it do them? Some programs will allow you to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and other even more abstruse calculations, and all at the data entry stage. The best of these allow serial calculations. For example, take A and multiply it by B; then divide the result by C; then add it to D. A program known as DB Master allows calculations for only two fields at a time: A plus B equals C. D plus E equals F. C plus F equals 327G. Other programs will only allow you to specify that certain relations between data exist, and then only</p>",
  "page-952": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">at the report-generating stage. Perfect Filer, for example, will allow you to specify that you only want your report to contain the people whose ZIP codes are between 20815 and 21903—but it won’t do any arithmetic at all. InfoStar, on the other hand, can do algebraic and numeric calculations and impose such logical conditions as “include this record if it meets X criterion”; “do this calculation unless the data field is Y”; “do this if conditions X <em>and</em> Y <em>OR</em> conditions P <em>or</em> Q exist.” Zowie!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">◻ What sort of “overhead” does the program demand? That is, what do you need to be stored on your diskette in addition to your data records? One trade-off might be that the more sort keys, subsets, list formats, and/or logical expressions you have, the less space you have for your data records. Unlike Perfect Filer, InfoStar creates an index file for every data file that you create. An InfoStar index file contains only the</p>",
  "page-953": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">field values of your sort key(s and addresses for each of your data records, but even so, with a lot of sort keys and with a nice, big data base, the index file is not going to be tiny. )</p><p>Playing with InfoStar—after a week hunched over the keyboard, I still can’t say I’ve learned it—was, in order, daunting, boring, thrilling, mystifying, frustrating, and annoying. The program comes with four (count em, <em>four</em> diskettes and three instructional tomes of a size and heaviness guaranteed to strike fear into the heart of a neophyte.

  "page-954": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">generating “quick reports.” All three are pretty to look at, slow as molasses to try to go through, and simpleminded in the extreme. The first one, for example, draws you a picture of a computer terminal on its screen just in case you’re suffering from selective blindness and can’t see the terminal you’re running the program on. My advice to those who buy InfoStar and who’ve ever even <em>seen</em> a computer before is not to bother with the tutorials—certainly not with the first one!—but to go straight to the training manual and start plowing your way through. It shouldn’t take more than a hundred years.</p><p>When I started playing with some of the data bases that InfoStar provides for its customers, I was excited. No, I was <em>thrilled</em>.

  "page-955": "<p>InfoStar uses most of the same commands that WordStar does, which is convenient if you happen to <em>like</em> control commands. I first began to get annoyed when I discovered that InfoStar does not use arrow keys. If you want to move your cursor, it’s CTRL-D, CTRL-S, CTRL-E, CTRL-X—the same commands WordStar uses and a major-league annoyance. Nor have any Function keys been assigned any values.

  "page-958": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">I got to “Edit mask,” “Copy attributes to field,” and “Enter algebraic expression,” I was thinking seriously about hara-kiri. We are <em>not</em> talking quick and easy here. We are talking call in the professionals or resign yourself to a lot of long, hard work. Considering that I don’t even get to keep the copy of InfoStar—I only own a 64K CP/M machine, and InfoStar requires a PC DOS and at least 96K of RAM and recommends that you use a hard disk (but will put up with two floppy drives provided that you can get 320K of memory on each disk)—I eventually just threw my hands into the air and gave up. There is no doubt in my mind that InfoStar is a terrifically powerful program that will allow you to do just about anything you want in the world of data bases. The doubt in my mind is whether I’m an ordinarily intelligent person who was thrown by some big-league complexity or whether I’m an absolute moron because I didn’t find the program “simple” and “easy to use.”</p>",
  "page-959": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">(Variations of the words “simple” and “easy” appear seventeen times in the InfoStar hype booklet; for example, “InfoStar is ... easy-to-use ... goes well beyond the capabilities of a simple data base system. InfoStar eases the job of managers.... It’s really quite simple. The whole process is really quite simple.... And it’s easy....” All this on one page, mind you.)</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">To sum it all up in a nutshell, InfoStar offers some <em>wonderful</em> features, particularly in the area of making things easy for the clerk typist/secretary who’s doing data entry. And it is, as advertised, lightning fast at calculations and sorting. Its use of WordStar commands is a drawback, and its refusal to allow the arrow keys to function, along with its insistence on making you plod through help screen after help screen that you’re really not interested in, can be infuriating; but I suppose the clerk typist who is forced 330to use WordStar—at only five years old the dinosaur of word-processing</p>",
  "page-960": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">programs—might find it convenient.</p><p>But if you, the doctor or lawyer or small business owner, want a custom-designed form or a custom-designed report, you’re not going to be able to delegate the job to a clerk typist/secretary/assistant. You’ll have to either hire a consultant to do it for you or resign yourself to spending days or even weeks mastering ideas and language that, to me, range from the arcane to the dumbfounding.</p><p>It’s really quite simple?</p>",

It also may help at times when you word-process memos.</p><p>The principle: create the basic pictures or prose yourself. But if pressed for time? Then farm out the details. Just as a secretary might put your memos in the right format on paper, he or she might also smooth your drawings. Or your art department might.</p><p>Here are other tips for graphics users:</p><hr class=\"section\">",
  "page-963": "<h4>Know Your Charts And Other Basic Tools</h4><p class=\"  start-chapter\">A line chart—a graph with the outlines of hills and valleys—is great when broad trends count more than the numbers themselves.</p><p>One glance at a good line chart can tell you if wok sales are up or down.</p><p>And for even better effect, you might try a curve chart, or area chart, filling in the area below the curves that the lines make.</p><p>“Instead of looking like a wriggly line,” explains Carl Herrman,</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And if you want to show sales trends in three wok</p>",
  "page-964": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">categories? Well, you can still use a filled-in chart.</p><p>“You might fill in the bottom one solid black,” says Herrman. “You might do a cross-hatch—parallel intersecting lines—on the middle one. And on the top one, you might have a straight-line effect or a lot of lines running close to each other.</p><p>“That way, you can readily see the difference between the three 332It’s more effective than three graph lines on top of each other.”</p><p>Another tool is a bar chart, with bars of different sizes—horizontal or vertical.</p>",

Home in on your main point. “If need be,” he says, “use a short narrative under the chart to back it up.</p><p>“In fact, you might be able to say something in words more 335simply than with a chart. If you’re trying to compare the cost of widget imports in the last fifty years and it’s doubled each year, then why not just say so in prose?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Also, avoid other forms of visual clutter.

  "page-974": "<p>In memos, don’t confuse your readers with a barrage of different typefaces. A little variety is good. But make sure you have a decent excuse, such as special points to stress or different categories of information.</p><p>“If you show off your fancy typefaces,” says my friend the Hard-Core-Bureaucrat, “it’s just a plague that’ll make your eyes ache. That’s one reason I’m down on fancy graphics for routine stuff. Some Macintosh users are going to produce memos that look like samplers from printing salesmen.”</p><p>Even on a thousand-word memo, use three of four typefaces at the most. Also, don’t stint on white space. Apple’s manuals for the Macintosh and its more expensive sister, the Lisa, are models of wise use of white space.</p><p>AT THE SAME TIME, KEEP IT LIVELY!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">If you can get away with it, why not try a little flair in your graphics and your points will be more</p>",
  "page-975": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">memorable.</p><p>A good model in many cases is the newspaper USA Today, which sports some of the liveliest graphics in the country.</p><p>It regularly publishes charts with such sexy facts as amount expected to go for health care in 1990 or the percentage of women who received haircuts and other beauty-shop treatments in 1983.</p><p>To jazz up the chart titled “Only Their Hairdressers Know,” an artist drew the face of a woman with her hair blowing out. The lengths of the bunched-up strands varied according to the percentages of women receiving different kinds of treatments. “Haircut” (76 percent was three times longer than “Coloring” (a mere 24 percent). Today the average micro user may not be able to produce such “hairy” graphics, but the future may be different. )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Snazzy graphics is like colorful writing.

Well, what a chance to liven up the workday of a young, talented 336aide who’d like a break from the typewriter, er, word processor!</p><p>Besides, on occasion, you can at least do what an editor may have done with the hairdresser chart—think up the basic idea.</p><p>KEEP THOSE CAPTIONS LIVELY, TOO</p><p>Imagine you’re writing captions for a hybrid of the New York Times and The National Enquirer.</p><p>Try to be accurate, clear, and interesting.</p><p>Snare the skimmers!

And in my opinion you might consolidate the “What?” and the “How?” here. Is there a right way and a wrong way of accomplishing the “What?”? Find out the right way before signing the contract.</p><p>“When?” Can you negotiate a penalty if the firm misses a deadline? And how about a bonus if it comes in early?</p><p>“Where?” Will the consultants do the work in your office? Theirs? On your computer? On someone else’s?</p><p>“How much?” Obvious.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In my opinion, you’d also do well to keep asking the “Why?”—to make the consultants justify whatever they have in mind for you. Why not? You’re the one</p>",
  "page-987": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">spending the money.</p><p>Also, at least consider the following:</p><li class=\" stretch-last-line\">Thinking small. Don’t bargain over the Who-How simply for the whole project; break it up into parts. “You say, ‘For this 340much money we expect to at least get a machine in the door,’” Harris suggests. “‘For this much money we expect to get the following diskettes for the following programs.’ ‘For this much money perhaps we’ll talk about customizing software.‘” If a consultant flubs an early part of the work or specifies the wrong programs or equipment, then you can more easily send him packing. “But,” you worry, “can a rival consultant pick up the pieces?” Well, you simply insist that the original consultant do his work in as standardized a way as possible. See if he can use a program like dBASE II or III—software with which thousands of other consultants are familiar.\nMaking the</li></ul>",

That’s another pick-up-the-pieces kind of protection.\nInsisting that any manuals for his software be complete and in plain English. If your consultant can write only computerese, in fact, you might not even want to bother with negotiations.\nBargaining if possible for a software warranty. Then, if you discover glitches in the software after it’s in use, the consultant won’t charge you to correct his own mistakes. You might not succeed here. But try.\nPossibly requiring the consultant to give you a discount on modifications or expansion of your system.\nNegotiating for full or part ownership of the software he may develop for you. But don’t count on getting rich from the sale of the programs. Adam Green, a software training expert, tells of a computer-store salesmen who, in that way, would appeal to customers’ greed. A taxidermist, for instance, might hear this pitch: buy from me, use the right consultant,</li></ul>",

Antitrust complications might arise if you don’t bear the financial risks of software development. If you do, however, you’re within your rights to demand exclusivity, just as the consultant is within his rights to charge you more for it. “Trade secret” is a key phrase both here and on the issue of ownership. “I recommend to clients that they go for 341trade-secret protection because copyright law protects the information only in the way it’s presented,” says William Wewer, a</li></ul>",

You don’t want to suffer because someone else has plagiarized or pirated software. Be certain you’ll own the master copies and instruction manuals that the consultant buys. Try to register immediately with the software company as the buyer or user of the disk. You want to know about updates of the product and about debuggings, which you won’t find out about with a pirated copy.

You don’t want an outsider blabbing to competitors.\nMaking the consultant agree in writing that he is working as your independent contractor, not your employee. Protect yourself against unfair Workmen’s Compensation claims and in similar ways.\nTrying to write into the contract your right to a full explanation whenever you want one. Make the consultant justify his recommendation for a certain computer or a certain program; he owes you at least oral explanation and perhaps a written one. How much experience has he himself had with the product? Is he going by someone else’s word? Whose?

  "page-1037": "<h4>To Get Ready</h4><p class=\"  start-chapter\">MODEM7 has two basic modes for Teletype-like communications, “Terminal” and “Echo.” For both parties to see both ends of the conversation, one must be in “terminal” and the other in “echo” if they are communicating directly. Just the “terminal” person will be able to record on his or her disk. The one in echo mode can’t save the material electronically.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Beginning, you should read your computer’s instructions for information on how many stop bits and data bits your machine normally runs with. And does it use odd, even, or no parity? You might also get this</p>",

Just find out what the settings are.</p><p>MODEM7 doesn’t provide for changing the settings. If the person at the other end can’t adjust them, either, and if those for his machine are different from yours, you’re out of luck if you don’t know how to fix the program code. You two may have to reach each other through an electronic mail service that mediates between machines. Often, however, micros are set for 1 stop bit, 8 data bits, and no parity, an informal standard. And just about all decent commercial programs for communications let you alter these settings. So does PC-TALK III.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In addition, even though MODEM7 itself won’t change its bit settings, your user group may have some free or low-cost programs that you can load up to do</p>",

The normal speed for cheap micro modems is 300 baud or about 30 characters per second; for the deluxe ones, 1,200 baud. Don’t worry right now about what a baud is. Just make sure you and the other person are both at the same speed. MODEM7 often is set at 300. Some versions may allow for changing the software to accommodate different baud rates, but the command may not work on your particular brand of machine. By the way, remember that you must consider the baud rate not only of the software but of the hardware. Simply adjusting your software to send at 1,200 baud won’t do the trick if your modem can reach only 300 baud. Remember, too, that MODEM7’s speed command won’t necessarily govern your modem’s transmission speed, just your software’s.</p>",

The technology engrosses him, but he lacks a sense of purpose. In Southeast Asia, meanwhile, a young man wrestles with calculations needed to build an irrigation dam. He thinks his figures are correct but isn’t certain, and thousands of people will die if the dam collapses.</p><p>Can the Chicago engineer somehow help his counterpart abroad?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There is a way if politicians for once will appeal to</p>",
  "page-1066": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the better instincts of technicians. An Electronic Peace Corps (EPC could bring these two together and offer the Third World some of the best international technical expertise via computer networks. )</p><p>Useful computers sell for around a thousand dollars, and much better, cheaper, smaller computers are on the way. What’s more, thanks to satellites, international communications prices are falling; and 1,000-word messages anywhere in the world, via special packet-switching networks, could cost just $1 each.</p><p>So the EPC needn’t threaten the taxpayers with a major burden. By essentially exporting knowledge instead of people, it in fact would increase the impact of economic-aid dollars. The EPC could emphasize basics like public health, agriculture, transportation, construction, manufacturing, and communications.</p><p>In carrying out the idea, a government or international agency might keep computer files listing:</p></ul>",
  "page-1067": "<ul><li>The skills and information required in specific underdeveloped countries.</li><li>People abroad who needed help.</li><li>Those who might be able to offer it.</li></ul><p>Most of the corpsmen wouldn’t even be computer experts—just people with the right technical knowhow. Some might be ex-Peace Corpsmen. Others might receive special cultural indoctrination similar to traditional Peace Corps training.</p><p>Once in the EPC, the corpsmen might regularly correspond via E-Mail at nights and on weekends or on occasion “talk” instantly to Third World counterparts. Of course, not every Third World beneficiary might use a micro. Some might submit written questions that local Peace Corps offices could pass on electronically (one way to mitigate the language problem).</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">E-Mail, incidentally, needn’t be the only form of computer communications available through the EPC.</p>",
  "page-1068": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">The organization could offer electronic bulletin boards with the names of people either needing or offering information on subjects like biological pest control or solar power. That way, the EPC’s beneficiaries would feel as if they had more of a choice.</p><p>In addition, there might be ongoing computer conferences on topics of common concern.</p><p>Obviously, the EPC wouldn’t replace foreign-aid experts in the field, and it wouldn’t aid people <em>directly</em> at the village level. It wouldn’t hand out lap-sized portables to barefoot farmers. Rather, the EPC would help engineers, doctors, scientists, and other people engaged in development in their own countries. Corpsmen in the field would work with local governments to make certain, for instance, that a New Delhi slumlord didn’t use the EPC to automate his dunning operation.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Typical EPC beneficiaries might be Indians trying to</p>",

Sometimes, incidentally, the “wrong places” include the warehouses of thieves, and computerized records could reduce the opportunities for corruption. Many problems are political or economic, of course. The EPC would limit itself to technical issues and try to be as apolitical as possible, just as the international Red Cross focuses on relief rather than ideology.</p><p>Another EPC beneficiary might be a communications specialist hoping to install a satellite link; for obvious reasons, better communications might be one of the EPC’s first priorities. The EPC might help domestic and foreign groups working toward this goal. Even countries with poor phone lines, of course, can receive some computer messages in the large cities.</p><p>Yet other beneficiaries could include:</p></ul>",

Micros could help 368his staffers keep abreast of the newest, best way to dig a well or treat a dysentery-stricken baby.</li></ul><p>The EPC wouldn’t just promote the flow of information from countries like the United States to the so-called lesser-developed countries. <em>Among</em> them, too, it would speed up the spread of practical solutions to common problems.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Learning of an efficacious home remedy, for example, a rural-assistance group in Ecuador might pass the information on for possible global dissemination.

Rather than preempting these efforts, an American or international EPC could aid them, thereby multiplying the benefits of the original organization and forestalling fears of electronic imperialism.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The EPC could have a domestic version, too. Because of lower communications cost, the Home Corps (a friend’s phrase might take more chances helping nonexperts without credentials. A gifted high school writer on Chicago’s South Side might tap out short stories on a school computer, for example, and a famous author across town might zip the files back, with comments easily inserted electronically.

Likewise, an Evanston business executive might volunteer help to a businesswoman in a small town many miles away. )</p><p>The most urgent need for EPC-style assistance, however, is in the Third World, where, because of technical backwardness, so many are starving. The idea isn’t so farfetched. In fact the Third World is already enjoying some similar help in a small way.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The CARINET computer network links the United States, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and Africa.

The technicians, sure enough, are far ahead of the politicians. One 369of the most distinguished technicians of them all—Arthur C. Clarke, the father of the communications satellites—describes the EPC proposal as “an excellent idea.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Reaction from Third World countries has been favorable. Naren Chitty, a Sri Lankan diplomat, says the concept is “a positive approach to technology transfer” in “these days when ‘electronic imperialism’ is a catchword.” And a Saudi Arabian communications specialist likewise advocates computer and networks for the Third World. He says: “I had a terrible argument</p>",
